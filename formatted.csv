Love to hear your experience.  For those considering taking on an apprentice or starting a program - here is some compelling reasons to give it a go... Firstly, an apprenticeship  program is one of the best investments a firm can make - U.S. Department of Labor statistics show that companies with apprenticeship programs earnt a return on investment of $1.46 for each dollar invested.  That is an average - in some sectors the ROI has been estimated at as much as $11 for every dollar invested !   Apprenticeship programs also provide employers with opportunities to improve workplace productivity, improve workforce diversity and build a pipeline of workers with the precise skills needed in your workplace (now and into the future). They can help shape the employee to your workplace culture and can strengthen your brand as an employer of choice; and finally boost employee retention.   #apprenticeship Watch:

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:How can we find hope and resilience to navigate the challenges and divisions that are affecting our communities, and what steps can we take to promote unity, compassion, and wisdom during these tumultuous times? [/INST] Despite the upbeat news on the vaccines, I think we are struggling mightily across the nation with three key issues: (1) Pandemic fatigue including Zoom fatigue; (2) Absence of interpersonal touch and connectivity; and (3) Upcoming holidays and ""tradition"" changes that distance us.  In a sense, the second ""surge"" feels, at least to some of us, worse than the first surge; the numbers are perilously high; we have a dysfunctional transition of power (whatever your political persuasion) that is harming our nation. Some of us have become more isolated than perhaps even necessary due to fear as others flaunt mandates and best practices.   In a sense, we are unaccustomed and unprepared for what is happening in our nation.  We can rightly ask: how do we move forward with grace and wisdom and perspective?  What compensatory mechanisms can we deploy to help all those who need help? And, what about our children and their ability to navigate forward?   I have one thought: I have hope.  I still believe despite some evidence to the contrary that people are decent and caring and at the end of the day, the better side of humanity and the wiser voices will rise to the top and be seen and heard.  I still have hope.   Do you?

Take this phrase: Time heals all wounds. That's just false. It heals some wounds and ameliorates others. But there are some wounds from which we don't recover fully; we navigate forward; we learn work-arounds. But time doesn't eliminate the trauma we've experienced.   Try this phrase: Sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me. How false is this? Imagine racial slurs and other affronts.  We need to take abusive language seriously; words do hurt and do harm. Goodness, how can we treat verbal abuse as non-hurtful?   My point is this: we easily repeat phrases without truly reflecting on their meaning. What better time than now, in the midst of a pandemic, racial tensions and uncertainty, to reflect on these referenced phrases and eliminate them from our lexicon. And, these are not the only two phrases that deserve to be set aside. Let's help our children by recognizing that traumatic events are not erased and words can do harm. If we recognize this, we can be in a position to help others in schools and workplaces and communities. P.S. Diamonds are not a girl's best friend.

At first, I was ready to drawn all sorts of conclusions and inferences.  I wasn’t holding back.  But... But, I think we need to wait.  We need to find out the facts. We need to understand the outbreak. Was it a player or two (or more) who went rogue in Atlanta without permission and/or protection?  Where did they go?  Was it transmitted on the plane through personnel on board or in the aircraft filters somehow?  Was it at any of the hotels with breaks in protocol for hotel workers?  Was it families of players or hotel or flight workers? I say “hit the pause bottom“ on conclusions and extrapolations until we know more. Yes, that assumes truth will rise to the surface.   Then we can decide what this all means for schools, sports and business. Waiting is wiser .... it just is.  Hard yes.  But wise.

Hopeless for Smith and my mother.   I give up.  They just don’t get the issues I raise; they are unresponsive; they make promises but can’t deliver. They fail to work openly on student psychosocial needs post COVID.   The Smith president focuses on new library (looks lovely ) and a new Culture of Care (w/o attention to impact of COVID on psyche of students). With a well regarded School of Social Work, Smith should know better.  The president has never seen fit to contact me (I am a former college President after all and not uneducated!).   Ironic that Smith has never had one of its own as president, only Seven Sister with that distinction.  Decades ago I was pushed by alums to apply for Smith presidency when Ruth Simmons went to Brown. I got a call from a headhunter, not Smith’s, after another person was chosen.  She said “I know 2 things about you. You have a non-traditional resume for a college president and you made it further than any Smithie in history of Smith.” Guess Smithies aren’t good enough for their alma mater, like some daughters aren’t good enough for their mothers.   Need to know when to call it a day.

This book, Trauma Doesn't Stop at the School Door, can inform reopening of schools, whether in person, online or in some hybrid fashion. Book is available as paperback and ebook:   https://lnkd.in/eCgEc8J  or Amazon.  Some teachers have asked for concrete items they can purchase to help students. It is for this reason that I have developed 3 products.  The 1st is described here:  it's  a tongue twister and word play book to be used at home or in school.  It has a variety of word games from spoonerisms to mad lib-like fill ins to word identification to shaped reading (reading in a shape). These are all strategies that can be deployed to manage the autonomic nervous system and encourage play while learning.  And, the tongue twisters allow students and teachers and caregivers to make mistakes, play together, learn words, practice pronunciation and see that learning involves trying again and again. This book is right priced and can be pre-ordered.  There are also bulk sale prices -- for 51 copies or more, the price is $6.00.  Here is the pre-order link.  Book available by end of August. Try it.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Predicting the future, or even conjecturing, in higher education, when the underlying social, economic, and technological landscape is in constant flux, can lead to frustration and anxiety due to its inherent uncertainty and the absence of reliable data. [/INST] I was just asked by an online pub. to predict what will happen in higher education in the coming years.   I had to fight the question. At best, predictions are based on facts and data and science and studies and experience in the trenches.  Even then, predictions are fraught with uncertainty.  Gamblers know that.  So, after pointing out the non-homogenous nature of higher ed and the absence of consistent change, I suggested that it was vastly better to provide conjectures rather than predictions.  The world is changing so fast; we’re in unknown territory.  I suspect we don’t have all the data and what data we have may be flawed. It is for these very reasons that we feel anxious and stressed and a tad (or more) out of sorts. We have no control; we have no gold at the end of the rainbow; we have an absence of certainty.  And it’s not like the messaging from our governments is consistent. The inability to predict is actually our problem. We can’t and therein lies the disquiet.  So, in response to the editor’s questions, I won’t make predictions. Instead, I’ll conjecture.  Watch for a later  post where I conjecture about higher ed.   One caveat: I can predict that most elite schools will not be on the frontline of innovation/change.  They can afford to do neither. That’s sad.

[/INST] I wanted to update my contretemps w/ my alma mater.  I observed, w/ anger and disappointment, that the new Culture of Care plan for fall students didn’t mention mental health, trauma responsiveness or even trauma. It only addressed physical safety, important tho that is. W/ the President copied, the head of mental health services shared the many mental health programs Smith has.  She shared recent hires.  She shared ongoing connections w/ students during the Covid-gap. Unfortunately, the response was fraught w/ generalities. While it noted trauma training of staff, there was no mention of trauma training for faculty. The response didn’t address why the Culture of Care failed to mention mental health. And the response did not share how they would help students, faculty and staff at the start of the new semester; they didn’t mention a trauma responsive plan or approach.  It was typically Smith-like: kind words at beginning and end and self aggrandizement in the middle.  Does Smith have nothing to learn about restarting?  I wrote back, noting the omissions. Smith has trained women to think well. Being that I’m Smith educated, why do they take me for a fool?  Smith’s lack of openness to improvement and its self-satisfaction is pitiful.

Where oh where was any reference to psychological wellbeing of students and trauma they have experienced of late?  Shouldn’t they include trauma responsiveness in any proposal related to care?

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:How can I rehabilitate the pejorative term 'engine' in educational and personal contexts to promote a more positive and empowering message around empathy creation? [/INST] Just  got a snarky comment to comment I made on IHE about a term I used.  The term was “empathy engine activation;” the comment was akin to:  “never use those words referring to students.” Ponder engines of empathy....the longer term for empathy engines, right?   This commenter (initials PC) misunderstands the term empathy engine and assumes it is anti-human; it is the opposite.  I could just say google.  But instead, I want to focus on why this term is so important and so apt and so central to human engagement.   Empathy is a key quality in humans and for developing human engagement. We often don’t  show empathy.  So we need to make sure empathy can be generated — activated.  An engine is not a negative term.  It is like a generator.  Think about the phrase “engines for change” — a good descriptor.  Demeaning “engines” demeans engines as if they were “just” for mechanics and mechanics aren’t worthy. Pooh bah. Engines are amazing.  We are human engines. Activation is a positive word.  Look at first three letters:  ACT.  The key is to not just talk about empathy but actually make it live in people.  To return to the phrase I used: We want to activate empathy engines.  Seems wise to me.  And necessary.  And valuable.   Thoughts? Anyone like mirror neuron activation better?

[/INST] The Land O’Lakes controversy has left me puzzled. The female image was done by a Native American artist. And what product had a Native American woman front and center — and not in a demeaning way?   Except ..... here’s what I recall as a teenager lo those many years ago that made me cringe and I thought that was why the image was removed.  If you bent the box (empty) a certain way, the woman’s knees became her breasts and she was sitting there with nothing covering her breasts.  Yipes.  Hadn’t the company realized that little and not so little boys were making a sexual display and a mockery of a Native American woman on their box?   Then decades later, when the image was to be removed, I thought: “Finally, someone smart knew about the knees/breasts swap and they are fixing it at ling last.”  Frankly it could have been corrected by a slight change in her clothing and she did not need to be removed. She did need to stop being the fantasy of young boys.  Back then, seeing breasts was a big deal — kind of like Playboy or Penthouse, neither of which seem needed with the Internet and the 60’s ....

But, yesterday was not a Happy College Signing Day. There is and was way too much uncertainty and concern. Even for those with a June 1 Signing Day (namely making a deposit -- it used to be non-refundable), these are times when college choice is not clear at all for students and their families -- in terms of location, safety, approaches to learning (in person, brick and mortar or hybrid), decisions without visits, possible gap years.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Should colleges reopen in the fall of 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and should a new model be considered as an alternative? [/INST] Here's an edited version of the response I posted to IHE on whether schools/ colleges should open in Fall 2020 in person. Final paragraph tells all.  Post: I'm wondering whether, if we put on a different lens, we'd see another option here. This is to suggest, assuming testing of high quality, that schools/ colleges reopen in Jan. 2021. And, there could be a soft launch in Fall 2020 for some students in small pods who want/need to be in school/college and for whom in person learning is key. The ""Covid-Pod"" approach would have different kinds of educational offerings -- everything from mini classes to pop ups. Here's the acid test: I was asked recently by a colleague: Were I still a college president, would I open in Fall 2020,  having engaged in a myriad of discussions? Honest answer: NO.  I would feel opening in a small town w/o sufficient medical facilities to handle 200 Covid cases quickly in a new peak and poor rural transport (no train or plane w/in an hour) and faculty/staff traveling from big distances presents too big a risk. I wouldn't want to increase the extant possibility of death. I need sleep at night; I would feel so responsible that every sneeze would send me into a frenzy of possible outcomes, many of which would make my current COVID nightmares pale.

[/INST] Not that long ago, although it seems like decades, Southern Vermont College closed.  I believed and still believe its death was premature.  But there was no stomach among new  #  #leadership  and most trustees for innovative ideas, restructuring and change. Instead, to avoid lawsuits (they got them anyway) and Mt Ida like situations, they caved like a deck of cheap cards. Sorry to be harsh but the mirror reflection if people look isn’t complimentary. Now the VT State Colleges are facing closure on three campuses.  I have read the reports.  I think death is premature.  Yes to change. Yes to innovation. Yes to hard choices. Yes to reallocation of spending.  The chancellor is a financial dude — former State Treasurer as I recall from my time.  I get the finances.   If he were an educational innovator, I suspect he’d see some pathways forward. I have reached out.  No response (yet).  Folks, there are ways forward.  Many moons ago, I was a restructuring lawyer. The principles from Title 11 served me well and with help, SVC started truly thriving.  For real. Then I left and there were changes that made no sense, administrative bloat, low enrollment (they sought better students), low low fundraising and a gift that kept on taking. I want to help if people will listen.  Time is now.

[/INST] I just wrote a piece on how to reopen schools and colleges post-pandemic.  I offer up 3 trauma-responsive changes. None cost money; they cost sweat equity, thought, creativity, reallocation of resources, new approaches, change.  Well, the first comment suggests: how expensive? How difficult?  How cost inefficient?   Now here's the point: folks can't see change as good. But, in this instance, the world has changed and going back to the status quo ante is a falsity. And anyone who does not recognize that placement tests and standardized tests post-pandemic and mandated upon reopening is really misunderstanding toxic stress, isolation, fear responses, ANS responses and the realities of a threat like COVID-19. Yes, these are all triggers for trauma.

I heard about your story and I think it's so cool that you're feeling curious about the world and making friends. But sometimes, the people we care about can get sick and we don't want to make them feel worse by being too close to them.

That's why we have something called social distancing. It's like giving the people we love some extra space to feel safe and healthy. Just like how you wash your hands to keep germs away, we keep some distance between us to keep the people we care about from getting sick.

I want you to know that it's okay to feel sad or to miss your friends when we're not together. But it's also super cool that you're learning about and taking care of each other in new and fun ways!

Can you draw a picture of you practicing social distancing and sending happy get-well thoughts to your friends?

A caveat: if schools close, that raises a host of issues not addressed here. 1.  Don’t pretend virus doesn’t exist by hiding reality. Being honest is key. How one expresses that honesty is a different issue. 2.  Do activities at start of class to lower autonomic nervous system; these should involve the senses. 3.  Consider pop-up courses for older students (short courses; small groups) and accurate activities on viruses for younger students.   Some pop up course suggestions: a) What is a pandemic (note word panic w/in it) and when have they occurred in US?; b) Are masks helpful in preventing disease spread; if so, for whom?; and c) Is quarantine the best strategy for disease containment? What does quarantine entail?  For younger students, consider these activities: a) Draw what viruses (any virus) looks like to you? Draw how it looks for real under microscope? Color images; b) What are vaccines and who creates them?  List current vaccines.  Note these topics don’t address COVID-19 virus head on; that’s purposeful. Knowledge is power as is stability and structure.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Reflect on two aspects of your recent experience/inspiration: the impactful qualities of a meaningful yet challenging film/visual and a critical evaluation of a widely used diagnostic tool, exploring how both require careful consideration and informed utilization. [/INST] I wanted to write quickly — more later — on two aspects of the  #TSS2020ATN .  First, I saw the movie Wrestling Ghosts: powerful, moving, sad, hopeful.  It needed a serious debrief afterwards.  Lots of ideas that needed processing and Care Room helped but not enough.  Second: I think now that we misuse ACE score as a diagnostic tool when it is neither destiny or a personal measure of   #health .   What it is is actually a gateway into understanding others and oneself.  But the number free standing and without more and without context and without PCEs is somewhat misleading.  Its power is housed in what it tells us at 10,000 feet and on the ground if used well and understood for what it is and isn’t.  That later “isn’t” requires that lots of folks￼￼ reconsider their use and understanding of ACEs.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What role, if any, should the authorities and Sarah Lawrence College administrators have recognized signs of abuse or neglect and taken action to stop Larry Ray, one of his students' parents, from living on campus for an extended period? [/INST] Well, another quandary with respect to which I need some insight.  I just read the stories about the predator/ cult leader Larry Ray and his involvement with students at Sarah Lawrence College (including his own daughter).  It took a while but he was just arrested (later than necessary). The NYMagazine piece is chilling. My questions do not relate to the power of a cult figure on young people.  We have many examples of this... sadly. Here’s what I don’t get:  where were the Sarah Lawrence administrators and staff? Apparently, at least one knew something was “up” in a specific dorm and did not address the issues.  Perhaps a parent can spend a night or two or three in a dorm but Larry Ray’s stay appears to be much longer.  Didn’t folks notice?  Wasn’t there an RA?  I frankly am hard pressed to believe the College could claim to be so hands off or ignorant or accepting of parents living on campus. Weren’t red lights flashing? Lives and relationships were ruined.  What responsibility did/does Sarah Lawrence have and are the personnel then there  still employed?  Years in question seem to be 2010 — 2014.   There must be another piece or two of three that I am missing.  I have known some administrators there — remarkable people. Explain to me what happened please.

[/INST] Help me understand this.  We are rightly worried about coronavirus (now renamed COVID-19) and a pandemic.  Forget for a moment our apparent incapacity to deal with it world wide.  I ordered 99.5% coronavirus mask for upcoming travel.  Call me an alarmist.   Now: The flu in the US affects more people and kills more people than the coronavirus.  Deaths are well in excess of 10,000 and affected individuals exceed 19 million.  Why does that reality not set off alarm bells? Is short, I am asking why flu falls into levels of low interest while coronavirus/COVID-19 is headlines?  Do we consider deaths by flu just part of our life cycle?  Help me understand.  Do data seem irrelevant?  Maybe data are wrong? Insights??

Here is another example: breaking a rule for decency and for caring. The fact that this student was kicked out of school is enough to make my blood boil.  Read this. Ask: what were the adults in charge thinking.  Oops. They weren't thinking and that's the problem.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What aspects of Kobe Bryant's life, both on and off the court, contribute to the enduring public fascination with his tragic death, despite criticisms of his personal struggles and controversies surrounding his legacy. [/INST] There has been some push-back on why we are paying so much attention to the tragic death of Kobe and his daughter Gigi and not paying attention to the many individuals who die tragically and ""out of order"" in everyday life. People think the attention to Kobe is undeserved.  Here are some reasons so many are touched: 1) We may not have known Kobe but he has been in our home for decades  (on television); 2) He started playing as a teenager and we marveled at but questioned his lack of a collegiate education -- so we wanted to ""see"" if he made it; 3) He was a rare talent who worked harder than anyone else, despite his abilities -- first to the gym, more reps than most; 4) He had commitment and passion for his sport and winning was his goal and he kept his eyes on the prize; 5) He was NOT a saint in many ways and had enough problems to sink most athletes (physically and with assault charges and marital woes) but he persevered; he apologized; he reconstituted his life; he built back his reputation from the sewer; 6) He cared about kids, his own and others; 7) He was a once in a generation talent, rarely seen and rarely encountered; and 8) He was a model for kids -- sort of like Be Like Mike (whose personal life was hardly in order and gambling etc.).  How's that for starters?

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What are strategies that can help mitigate the reactivation of traumatic symptoms and promote healing in school shooting survivors, including students, educators, and families, on the anniversary of such incidents? [/INST] Trauma has tentacles that wrap themselves around survivors.  That statement expresses this reality: school shootings have lasting effects on the survivors: students, teachers, families, communities. For proof, we need first to recognize the traumatic symptomology that survivors show. Consider this article and the LA Middle School teacher's continuing struggle with a school shooting in which she was injured.   https://lnkd.in/eAbHYVY This article and the teacher's symptomology are also why anniversaries (commemorations) of a trauma need to be planned thoughtfully, recognizing that the impact of trauma remains long after the actual incident. With the upcoming Parkland shooting anniversary on Feb. 14, we should all pause to reflect on what would produce healing that day as opposed to reactivation of our autonomic nervous systems.  And, this applies whether one was there, related to someone there, knows someone there, was involved in another school shooting, or is an educator who worries about shootings.  And, for the record, this isn't even a complete list of all affected parties.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:How can an expanded role for educators, similar to that of ER doctors, improve student success and health outcomes by connecting with students and families outside the traditional classroom? [/INST] There was a recent article in the NYTimes about the work done (or not done) by an ER doctor and the ER in general.  The author cites a study undertaken at Yale’s ER that enabled the doctors and staff to do home visits to prevent repeat ER visits.  The point was this expanded role actually saved time and money and enabled improved patient care.  Motto was no longer “up (into hospital bed) or out (leaving ER).  There was connection and intervention.  And it improved revisits by 50%.     In my new book, Trauma Does Not Stop at the School Door, I make a similar argument about educators.  We need to expand our role; we can’t be content to be deliverers of content in a classroom.  I get that this will bother some, especially university professors.  But ask:  Isn’t the goal of educators to enable student success?  Isn’t the role of ER personnel to enable patient health?  Times have changed.  #educationreform  means that the scope of roles and thinking about our roles narrowly may not serve those we serve.  Ponder that as we approach 2020. Book will be released by TC Press in June 2020.

In my view, it requires input and buy in from those within an institution.  Consultants can't do that.  Reaching out to staff and client/patients/students will make change happen more effectively.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:As a writer of trauma literature, I aim to shed light on the often-overlooked but crucial issue of physical trauma within schools, caused by school workers, and the need for schools to prioritize trauma response and trust-building to create a safe environment for students. [/INST] I just was listening to the news and there was another assault by someone working in a school on a student.  What school worker bodyslams a child?  I write about trauma. I usually focus on trauma that impacts students that occurs OUTSIDE the school or by an intruder/shooter into a school. I have not focused -- until now -- on trauma within the school caused by school personnel. Yes, I have observed teachers/professors causing non-physical trauma through poor pedagogy and demeaning words/acts, and I am well aware, sadly, of sexual assaults by school/university personal on a student. But, now I think I need to focus more attention, sadly, on physical trauma within schools.  It is not between students; it is not bullying student-to-student; those are bad enough. It is teachers/aides/guards assaulting students and causing harm —physical and psychological.  All I can say is that creating trauma responsive schools is critical and stopping trauma on students by adults in schools must stop.  No question about that. We need schools to be places that foster truth and trust.  We need both.  When assaults on students occur by professionals within schools, trust is destroyed.  Truth is, one hopes, still thriving if victims come forward and are believed.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Reflecting on Tiger Woods' redemption and resilience, how can the universal human capacity for growth, recovery, and self-improvement through adversity serve as an inspiration for personal and collective renewal, and what lessons can be drawn from his journey as a role model for overcoming figurative ""mulligans"" in life? [/INST] I can’t help but look at the photographs of Tiger Woods after the US won the President’s Cup.  Yes he brought the team back. Yes, he won his three matches.  Yes, he was one of two winning player coaches. But for me, the photo shows a man who has come through hell and in the process, he found his smile.  I may be wrong but in his youth, I don’t remember seeing such authentic smiles and such warmth with other players.  I recall an automaton.  I think there is a lesson here for us all.  We can find our way back.  We can recover our smile.  We can become a better version of ourselves.  We can be role models after all.  It is comforting and memorable even to see joy return to Tiger.  Or maybe with age, there is a different kind of joy.  A mulligan .... that’s a gift and human term for a do-over.   It’s not cheating.  It is the product of life’s many lessons.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What role do words play in shaping our emotions and experiences, often having a more profound impact than they're given credit for, and how should we strive to wield them responsibly in our personal and public lives? [/INST] It is raining hard in DC. Cleaning the city perhaps?  On all levels.  Anyhow, what a day to read and snuggle.  I was reminded yet again about the power of reading and the emotions it can evoke -- whether in adults or children. Reading can literally touch your heart -- so can words.  I just finished Delia Owens moving story, Where the Crawdads Sing.  Kya, the protagonist, learns to read late in her childhood and remarks after reading a poem something to this effect, ""Who knew words could carry such power?"".    I raise this for two reasons today.  Words have power, both positive and negative.  We relish the positive words and the enormous power evoked in us through them. But, we also have negative and discriminatory words and hurtful words (oft-times said in times of anger or in bullying or in a show of power).   These words have power too.   I'd suggest we look more carefully at all our words, starting with our leaders and political candidates and politicians.   We need to be careful. Words aren't just letters strung together.  Repeat: words are not just letters strung together.  They can hurt like weapons, causing psychic injury, and they can make one's heart leap with joy.  Seems the latter is way preferable by any measure.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Reflect on the state of polite discourse in our society, where individuals in positions of power, influence, and authority are frequently shown to disregard and mock decency, kindness, and honesty. [/INST] Decency.  Kindness.  Honesty.  Truth.   Where have these values gone?  Consider mean tweets from our President. Poor role modeling.  Patriot’s cheating again and professing lack of intent.  Poor role modeling.  Again.  A Florida Republican representative arrested for DUI denigrates Hunter Biden for addiction.  Pot calling the kettle.... And poor role modeling.  Golfer Patrick Reed not admitting his own rule breaking.  Poor role modeling.  And don’t get me started on the Astros.   Instead of Melania Trump’s “Be best” — which isn’t proper English — what about “Be decent and be honest?”.  That’s a motto worth fighting for and adopting in words and deeds.  Would that people in power and the public eye stepped up to speak and act decently and truthfully.    And I recently have focused on why it is so hard to speak up and out.  Why is it so hard to ask people to be better?  Complex to do, especially when swimming upstream against a culture that seems to tolerate bad acts. But, enough already.   I just spoke up in no uncertain terms to a person I dated in my youth (initials BC) who back then crossed clearly set sexual boundaries I believed in and denigrated me for them.  It took me 45 years. But there’s a lesson there that applies to the above observations: better late than never.

This book is English/Spanish.  And, it has other key features: it is on indestructible paper so it can be used by several classes and wiped clean and with very young children (sort of like cloth books in my era or board books but better); it is a book that can and should be read and re-read and it works in a circle in a sense, playing hide and seek again and again.  It has tips for adult readers to enable them to enhance the reading with their children/students/ friends/relatives. Finally, it deals with object constancy, something of critical importance to children who struggle with trauma.  It is a book for the holidays and thereafter.  Enjoy and learn and play.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Consider the following college, facing enrollment decline and economic strain, adopting a strategic downsizing approach, including cost-cutting measures such as staff reduction and facility adjustments, to ensure stability and future viability in the face of unsustainable growth. [/INST] So, I have been reading and talking to folks about the impending merger (closure) of Marlboro College with Emerson.  Read recent article in Boston Globe.  All this brought me to realize a strategy that would have worked for Southern Vermont College and some other colleges in distress.  The idea:  right size them.   Could write more but for now: With impending and evident enrollment declines, shrink the spending side to match enrollment until new enrollment approaches are in place.  Yes.  Downsize in the near term.   That would cost some jobs within faculty and staff.  At SVC, I would have torn down old dorms which would cut costs and staffing.  I would have doubled up in new dorm on two floors and rented space for overflow.  I would have had a lean mean administrative team.  (Another leader bloated it for several years with outsized salaries.) Right sizing is hard but smart.  Look at Sterling College.  If past growth isn’t sustainable, adjust and fast.  Don’t bleed to death or ask trustees for repeated end of year shortfall bailouts. Goodness knows, Higher Ed needs to get smarter. Right sizing is smart and doable.  Otherwise, hearts will be broken with unnecessary closures.

[/INST] Just an oddity on this post-Thanksgiving Friday.  There are sales galore.  Now focus on this: The US government was recently “selling” a fake US university in Detroit to foreign students.  And it “looked” real enough that students enrolled and paid thousands.   Who knows where the money went.  Now, the fake government was a success in trapping some of the student visa fraud.   This fake university success occurs as real universities/colleges are failing — and they are desperately trying to get students, domestic or foreign.   Is anyone seeing irony here?  The fake university enrolls students with ease while the real school admissions officers are struggling?

One more thought:  is setting up a fake university the best use of government talent and resources?  If these gov. folks are so talented, why not have them work on real education at real educational institutions in need?   What a waste of talent and dollars on so many levels.  #  #colleges   #educationreform

[/INST] What a world we live in? For traumatized students, this is about the worse that can happen, except physical punishment.  Traumatized children often feel isolated and have struggles to attach. And this is how we treat them? And if a student were not traumatized, this would make them a trauma survivor.  What has happened that we enable educators to behave in these ways?  What is needed is a radical change in how we think about and execute on punishment and discipline. We often blame the child (or student) for what happened to them NOT what they did.  Time for a change --- decades ago actually.  Watch for my new book from TCPress June 2020 titled Educating for Trauma.  In the meanwhile, yipes.

[/INST] On this Veteran’s Day, I have to wonder why we are not doing all that is possible to save Veterans from committing suicide.  Programs and initiatives  exist; technology exists.  But, we don’t act with all deliberate haste.  And each day we wait, over 20 Veterans die.  There are approaches, including a very recent study on suicide prevention tied into doctors who see Veterans within the year before death.   I am finishing Shulkin’s new book and am deeply struck by how much his vision of his tenure differs from reality.  As with many leaders who fail, he has not been able to own his mistakes, at least as of page 215 in the book.  Isn’t that tragic too?  He tells a tale in the name of Veterans but so far it is a book justifying his own behaviors.  Sure, politics is a tough game but the story Shulkin tells seems remarkably self serving.   I worry about our saying we are helping when we are really real aggrandizing or self enriching or self promoting.  Leaders committed to being in service to others focus on these others.   On this Veterans Day, it is good to remember what it means to serve — and we can serve in many ways.... and we can honor service and we can help Veterans when they leave service.  That isn’t asking too much.  It is the minimum we can provide.

[/INST] I just read a piece in Medium written by an adult whose childhood dentist hit her in the face. Sadly, lots of children are traumatized by the adults with whom they engage — not just parents.  Doctors, dentists, religious figures, coaches and even neighbors or contractors are implicated.  What happens is that children are silenced by the trauma and can’t speak up and out. The freeze response to trauma freezes our voice.  We then have children who hold their trauma within.  That is why I wrote a forthcoming book published by Columbia Teachers College Press (June 2020) titled Educating for Trauma: Strategies for Student Success.  Kids bring their trauma to school in suitcases of different sizes.  We need to help them now.  Waiting does not make trauma disappear. No indeed.  It just gets sublimated and cabined away.  Its symptomology remains.  The book will, I hope, help.

[/INST] The Mount played a pretty remarkable game last night against Georgetown. And, for the first 3/4 of the game, they had it under control and then the gas just left the tank.  Free throws were not made, tightness set in and shots made earlier did not fall and Georgetown buckled down and hit their shots. Here's what this shows me:  The Mount has a stunningly good coach; their Mount players will be doing 100's of free throw drills today; the Mount players will augment training for endurance play; and they will practice 1 minute drills again and again.  As to GT, they can come back like this on a team that is unranked.  But it is not an ideal strategy for sure for the long season ahead. And seeing Patrick Ewing coach: amazing actually: he was always calm on the court (my favorite Knick) and as I recall he couldn't make free throws too well.  I liked his style of coaching.  He was more animated than I ever saw as a player. He needs some new and better players. I'll bet he'll be able to recruit.  All in all, good lessons here: the little guys are not so little; the big guys can't wait for the spigot to just turn on. College basketball is all about improvement.  What a night.

I think that lies/ bad acts circle round to haunt those who generated them — like ghosts. Even faraway travel isn’t an eraser.  I had to threaten one former leader with a lawsuit for lying!  There was blindness of those in power to the realities of the college’s true state and inability to develop timely creative solutions — not just throwing $$. I get that college’s fail.  Some shouldn’t ... SVC needed quality folks in power who reached out for quality help early.  They had to share the situation and issues with guarantors, lenders and prior leaders; could have saved SVC.   So, as I look at the book I wrote, stunningly illustrated by Dianne Sunda, I smile at the children’s tale but have more than a twinge of sadness/anger. The book serves as SVC’s obituary. Truth and ghosts do prevail in due time. Yes, there are profound messages here for other businesses in trouble.  Tell the  truth!

Now, let me get this straight:  Gates never ever either saw or engaged in any sexual escapades involving young girls and only saw Swedish beauty and her 15 year old daughter (one-off event)?

I am concerned that we move so slowly in education that many children who could benefit from improvements are left behind.   Today, I was listening to folks chatting about 5G and its implementation hurdles.  One speaker observed that we needed to be heartened by some changes — the move away from pay phones and phone booths to cell phones.  Those phone booths are anachronistic.  One generation and they are gone.  No coin calls basically.   I wonder whether the speed of technology and its acceptance can be transportable into education.  Why not get the next generation accustomed to trauma responsive institutions with problem solving and interdisciplinary efforts?  We think of Hampshire’s reforms as innovative.  Really? Many have pondered problem focused and thematic learning for decades but fear and tradition stand in our way when implementation is at issue.

So, here's my question: What can you get for $16 billion if we had other spending priorities?  What disease could we cure for that amount?  Could we have universal early childhood education for that amount?  We have legislation with mandates that are unfunded; suppose we looked at some of those to fund?  A recent NY Times piece noted the proliferation of child pornography on the web and the absence of sufficient resources allocated to stomping out this problem. The legislation exists; the dollars don't. Bottom line: How can a private company get a $16 billion no bid contract when we have so many other needs?   Ask yourself: What can $16 billion buy?

I just read an article on donations to colleges and universities and how they failed to vet the source of donations — namely from Jeffrey Epstein. The Higher Education Times (a UK publication) said anonymity was an approach although not fully protective.   3 thoughts: 1.  How carefully ARE donations actually vetted in real life on campuses?  Sure, smaller colleges can vet more, and big donations stand out everywhere as worthy of vetting.   But how much money comes in from sources that, if we looked, would be deemed institutionally unacceptable?   2.  Cozying up to donors is a big part of fundraising.  So didn’t these institutions meet and stay in touch w/ Epstein?  Harvard said it isn’t returning the $$ it got. Is that because it was received before convictions? Didn’t Harvard send updates/reports to him?  Couldn’t Harvard show some grace and donate an identical amount to fund for his victims?  Ok: just return it. 3.  Wouldn’t it be easy to fool a college/university as to a donation’s source? Just create layers. Now ask: Is Sackler money being returned or just new $$ not bring taken by educational institutions? I’d say we need to do more thinking about donor source. Honorary Degrees too.

Stop outs, drop outs, high school grads that never went to college, Veterans, workers retooling it improving, seniors, women with children — non trads of all sorts who are becoming trads..... A small non-elite college needs to reframe who its students are and how to serve them well — very well.  Why would non-elite colleges try to get “better” high school grads when that will never work near or longer term?.  Think boldly, innovatively about new populations to serve.  Goodness, bring anchored in old ways is doomed.  Realize that way ahead of 2026; realize it three years ago and had this been done successfully, more than a handful of  small colleges would not have closed. And if stuck in past, don’t lead in US.  Go to another nation that has different demographics and do more of same.  Of course, absence of innovation anywhere in the globe is fatal. Demographics aren’t only driver for education!!!

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What are the potential benefits and drawbacks for an incoming first-year college student who is drawn to an institution's unique qualities, perhaps sensing an opportunity to be part of a pioneering effort amidst fiscal challenges. [/INST] I just read an article in InsideHigherEd about the 15 new incoming students at Hampshire College. IHE referenced a Boston Globe article describing the feelings of these students and those who chose to attend elsewhere.   Because Hampshire is struggling, they limited 1st yr enrollment.  And of those accepted, only 15 students deposited.  Reflecting on small entry classes, why is  it necessarily a bad idea to be one of those students and for some, it cld be beneficial. Start w/ this: the students know the institution is struggling. They chose to go to an institution that is free spirited and now working to solve fiscal issues.   Might that be like an adventure for some? A bonding experience?  Being a part of something bigger?  Pursuing new pathway in higher ed?  Isn’t that the Hampshire way?  Anti-complacency?  Yes, it might be a costly student experiment—financially and otherwise. But, this is not pro forma college with consistency; this is like an entrepreneur’s start up.  I raise this because I’m still struggling to save a small college that wld clearly need a soft reboot. I don’t think all students wld avoid that. Some might like the effort, energy, commitment. Just saying: small entry classes aren’t all bad. These 15 students are bold and brave.  Bravo/brava. Rainbows.

But I have some remaining thoughts (perhaps jet lag induced): 1.  I get the many benefits of travel. But, both the mind and body need to be in the same place for a while to re-center.  That’s why I planned an extra day in LA.  I can tell it’s needed before I give a workshop.  If I did it tomorrow, it would be a fiasco. Hot tea and a shower; simple needs. 2.  There’s been lots for sale in every airport — duty free and not.  Guess having a captive audience encourages sales. So does the desire to hold something or have something to trip off memories.  And even if duty free is not cheaper, it sounds cheaper.  3.  We falter with transitions — from job to job, school to school, nation to nation.  We’d do well to focus on how to make folks feel welcomed to a new nation and welcomed home after a long trip.  Signage matters.  Friendly faces.   4.  Customs dude in Canada  asked where I was coming from.  Since when?  Last flight?  Place of origin.  Over the last week?  And then the question: was travel for business or pleasure? Why either/or? Can’t it be both? I’m a touch cranky.  Perhaps that part of travel too....

[/INST] Recently, at a child care center in Okinawa, the art therapy teacher asked, “What makes you qualified as a trauma expert?” Not the 1st time I’ve been asked that question. The question is really a surrogate for: “Why should we trust you?” Stated another way, “Are you authentic?” Very legitimate. I often answer 1st (sometimes only) w/ my academic bona fides: I’ve been an educator for 4 decades. I’ve studied, written and spoken about student success and how trauma impedes positive  outcomes. I’ve developed trauma responsive programs. I’ve guided schools thru and after crises. I’m a certified psychological first aid provider.I’m in a trauma program at Rutgers Grad School of Social Work. I have a new book emerging titled: Gen Tt Goes to School. What I sometimes share and I suspect is better preparation: I was part of an effort to reopen a school post 9/11. I was president of a college w/ more than 1 traumatic moment, including suicide of the CFO.   But there’s more. I’ve personally experienced trauma. I have an ACE score of 7. My mother abused me; I witnessed her abusing 1 of my brothers. My husband developed Alzheimer’s and was physically and psychologically threatening. Bottom line: personal experience, well processed, trumps academic learning any day. Can’t beat real life.

I do pack light (never check) and try to get from Point A to Point B in the quickest way (the price is worth it). I use airport lounges. Here are 4 things I’ve learned from my recent trip from DC to Okinawa and back.  I write this as I sit on one of several flights home. (1) I roll my clothes.  Yup.  Roll them and they take up less space and they rarely wrinkle.  (Our dog, a basset, is more wrinkled.) (2) I’m trying a melatonin regime for the 1st time —taking it at night starting before I leave and then switching to a.m. with a gap day and continuing when home.  So far so good. Will provide an update.   (3) It’s good to try new things — judiciously.  Japanese toilets are really remarkable but I wasn’t game to try them in a public place (the gizmos that is). Kept wondering about the quality of the water.  My point: Try new things smartly.  Don’t try some new food if you’re going on a boat excursion. Eat local. Why have McDs? Local food is fresher.  (4) Look at television a bit for several reasons: sports and language. In Japan, lots of baseball and ping pong. My point:  it has a cultural value.  And listen to the language of the nation where you are. News Japanese is well worth it. OK — there might be a Part 4.

[/INST] Part 2: Okinawa I spent a number of hrs at Kadina Air Force base and off base w/ military personnel stationed in Okinawa.  Many thoughts but here are 3: (1) Service members do a remarkable job protecting our freedom but it isn’t easy on them or their families. They are moving frequently, adjusting to new homes, cultures and jobs. That’s why tradition-from music to ceremoniesis so impt. It creates continuity in world of discontinuity. (2) I spent time w/ military children on and off base. As someone w/ expertise in trauma, I saw too many kids w/ autonomic nervous systems on alert.  I cld identify, among some 30 kids, 4 or 5 who weren’t in a gd spot, evidenced by factors including: trouble concentrating, diminished memory, flocking (hanging off stranger’s leg), not sensing personal space, trouble w/ abstractions. We wld be wise to have trauma sensitive child care centers across the globe w/ common traditions creating continuity. 3. Our military are well trained, and training and preparation are perpetual.  Not just physical training either. Outside the military, continuing education isn’t ubiquitous.  We’d do well to require those, even at the top, to continue learning, challenging themselves w/ new advances and constant exposure to younger people.  Businesses wld benefit.

[/INST] As I leave Japan, having spent 5 days in Okinawa, I am struck by so many things.  Here are a few worth, I hope, sharing.   1.  In Okinawa, Americans are not welcomed still in many ways.  And except when on a US military base, there is a sense of American imperialism, where we have overtaken an island not our own.  As Americans we are used to being seen as  “top dog”, so it is important I think to recognize that other peoples are not always fond of us — for good and bad reasons. 2. I have traveled near and far but few places feel as foreign and with so little English as Okinawa.  Were I stationed there, I would learn their language — not only to navigate but to show respect.  Not just hello and goodbye.   3.  The local Okinawa crafts, found in hidden places on the island, represent amazing artisans, many of whom are not frequented by Americans.  Americans tend to go to “touristy” places, theme parks with fake crafts.  It is different to see weavers weaving and smell the wet clay and see the glass blowers blowing.  And buying that art, whether or not objectively valuable, has enormous value in terms of personal cultural artifacts and connection to people and place.   Watch for installment two!

So awaiting 1st leg at Gate Z10 (who even knew Z gates existed?), I read 3 separate articles in NYTimes that are intertwined and message on leadership.  Start with this from an interview of Prof. Anita Hill. She states: “Leadership at the top, on any issue, in any institution, is what changes the game.”   Then turn to piece on p. B7 about mistakes.The author observed that we stick to things that don’t work (ed leaders of failing colleges, wake up!) because of “commitment bias.”We cling to prior behavior because our egos don’t like to be embarrassed.   Then turn to piece on Boeing on p. B6 where Boeing CEO said company made a “mistake” relative to handling of the absent warning light in some Max jets. It kept problem secret. Now combine these pieces. Boeing made a set of errors. Surely that showed commitment bias. Change requires a new leader. Bottom line: Boeing’s leader isn’t for change.  Colleges w/ leaders who replicate past approaches are doomed. Boards need to get a change leader if they want change, someone who’ll overcome commitment bias. It took 3 articles to make 1 key point: fire leaders who aren’t change agents when you need change.Otherwise you will have a paper house, like one pictured.

If you are a leader and your institution fails  and falls into sewer and you have been leader for more than a couple years, you own it ... denial is both unleader-like and disingenuous.  Kerr fell in my book; courage and making hard decisions are the hallmarks of real leaders.  Sadly, we are seeing too many examples of leadership failure.

There is a key point there: not everyone can speak up and out and deal with the aftermath too.  If you can speak up and out, even with some backlash and risk, it will help others.  Anita Hill taught us well: speak truth to power, even when power does not listen.  So, those can, please speak.  Our world will be better for it.

Reading, vocabulary, a love of words, creativity and imagination are key to educational success.   I’ve puzzled over how to get books into the hands of kids that need them most. I do readings in all sorts of venues but that doesn’t give kids books to take (except in exceptional situations where organizations/schools have placed large orders). I’ve been reflecting on offering books in unusual, unexpected  settings like doctors’ offices.  Physicians could give them to patients free or subsidize their purchase. Pediatricians, OBs. I also think bodegas are options—at counters like candy, gum or magazines in supermarkets.   See photo below of the “mini pop-up kid bookstore” I created for a small market in DC.  If it works there, I’ll expand to other bodegas.  I supply the stand/books (books are reasonably priced to vendor) and they can sell them at wholesale, retail  or give them away. Perhaps the effort could be underwritten by some  organizations, communities, merchants or churches.

There was many lessons here in terms of why failure persisted and flaws were so slow to remediate. I want to focus on just 1 now.

The doctors at UNC at several points considered sending patients elsewhere and one physician is quoted as asking:  Would you send your own child here? Once the answer had been yes and then it turned to no. Lesson: if you wouldn’t send your own child here, don’t send anyone else’s.  The litmus year of quality is whether you or your family would use the services or product.  Consider that question at Boeing with its Max plane. Consider that question at some schools and colleges. The question begs institutions to turn into somewhere or something they’d encourage their family to use (assuming appropriateness as surely you’d only use a pediatric cardiac team if your child needed that).

[/INST] Well, this is a post of a different nature. Many moons ago, an old friend Steve Leveen asked if I would do a podcast where he interviewed me for his site and project: America the Bilingual.  I did but promptly forgot about the initiative until he just completed a podcast called Buds of Bilingualism and there I am speaking Icelandic.  It brought back memories, reminding me of my own tradition where I give the introduction to my remarks in the language of the nation where I am speaking. I had recently been in the Yakama Nation and started my remarks at Heritage University in Yakama. So, you are interested in how to use foreign language to develop cultural competency, this podcast's for you. Link's below.  But, for me, the podcast also raises a deeply troubling question in American education. We seem to look down at our non- or beginning English speaking students. Because they do not speak our language, we assume them to be ""lesser.""  Yet, they speak more languages than most Americans -- they speak their native language plus at least some English. So why do we denigrate others who speak a non-English language well and are learning English rapidly? Can you explain that?  Here's the podcast link:

[/INST] I want to share a concept in my new book on trauma that is  counter-intuitive.   When disasters strike like shootings at schools/colleges, we often go on lockdown and then release kids to families or older students to their dorms or homes.  We even shut down institutions. If the end of a school year is upon us, we wrap things up and folks depart. I think more attention needs to be paid to what I call “processing in place.”  Instead of separating people, we need to focus on and foster community.  Instead of going away, we need to go back and share with those who were there.   Ponder the experience of soldiers when they get stateside and lose their buddies.  Is that why vet suicides occur at VA hospital sites—the soldier is with others like them in some sense?   In the case  of UNC-Charlotte, the end of the semester is not trauma’s friend.  Perhaps the university will extend the semester, allowing students, faculty and staff to process in place — if they want that. How we process in place isn’t a simple idea and if space is tainted, that’s problematic.  More on those points later.  But you can’t process in place if you aren’t in place — physically or perhaps virtually.   Ponder the power of processing in place with me.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Propose a cy pres award distribution model for wealthy parents and coaches convicted of bribery and related crimes, redirecting their penalties towards supporting low-income students and under-resourced institutions in education. [/INST] Folks, yesterday saw guilty pleas of a dozen or so wealthy parents and coaches for bribery, illegal money transfers across state lines, and tax fraud among other charges.  Felicity issued an apology, seemingly sincere.  Here's an idea I want to refloat:    When we get to the punishment phase, I want to reiterate the idea of a cy pres award. Elite colleges were harmed. True. But the whole incident shines a spotlight in inequality in education and across America. And, ironically, the bribes ostensibly went to help low income kids. Yup, that's the tax fraud part. So have those pleading guilty do just that: donate to a cy pres fund that benefits low income kids and the non-elite small colleges that serve them. Redistribute the cy pres to colleges with more than 40% Pell eligible students and/or 50% first gen students and under 1200 students and endowments under $10 million. Then use the funds for scholarships and institution sustainability. The cy pres agreement would be part of a court ordered settlement and the distribution could be decided by a cy pres committee or designated court appointed official. Make lemonade out of lemons. Force these parents to do what they actually said: give to help low income students. Do good from bad.

[/INST] So, first, silence for a few days does not mean I am not pursuing approaches to try to save SVC (and other small colleges that serve students — nursing, Rad tech, cj, social services, business.) The articles today in Chronicle of Higher Ed are telling about the price students pay when their college closes.  Can we do better?  Can we help these institutions?  Surely we can try.  Without trying, we get nowhere.  So I’m trying on several fronts - legal and fundraising and gov.    On a somewhat related topic, watch for a new post on colleges issuing certificates of failure to show students it is ok to fail.  Not sure what psychologist or professor dreamt up this idea and I appreciate that learning involves risk taking.   But, certificates of failure?  To hang on a wall?  To acknowledge competition?  To make bad grades acceptable?  I see vastly different ways to help students other than  issuing failure certificates.    Piece to appear shortly.  At small non-elite colleges, can you imagine certificates of failure?  Wait til you see them — look like degrees except for failure.  Yipes.  Another Yipes.  I believe in real degrees and real support.  Not diplomas of failure.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What if wealthy elite colleges reached out to support underfunded regional small colleges, but instead of receiving assistance, the effort served to widen the financial gap between them and ultimately put more small colleges at risk? [/INST] I have often thought rich colleges could partner with less wealthy colleges — sort of academic adoption.  When endowment size was an issue that threatened their continuance, I thought this was an idea: invest in a neighboring small colleges and help them thrive and now survive.  No takers.  Williams wasn’t interested when I asked and their president then (not Morty Shapiro) showed overt disdain.  I actually chatted with famous Yale endowment advisor (Swensen) and he saw merit. That said, the rich get richer.  And small colleges that serve communities and students who are not going to elite colleges for any number of reasons, get poorer.  Sure, some small colleges are not being innovative and creative.  I still believe SVC can be saved and I continue to pursue different avenues regardless of naysayers.  Giving up isn’t in my vocabulary.  SVC didn’t train nurses and Rad techs to give up on patients.  We didn’t give up on students who struggled.  So, why give up on SVC?  Bravo to the author!

Something happened in the recent past. I said, well, maybe but more likely something didn’t happen: fundraising, grant raising, admissions, athletic recruiting, poor acquisitions.  But, I explained I hadn’t seen financials or data or what was filed with accreditors.  The group looked at me quizzically and I just looked at them and said, beats me.  My job now is to try to save it.  Anyone here have 3 million and want a college named for them? A few laughs and no immediate takers but one fellow said:  I bet there is someone like that.

[/INST] Something is drastically wrong with college accreditation, both in terms of who is getting and maintaining accreditation and who is losing it.  Bennett College was cited for lack of resources; it had an opportunity to raise $$ before the appeal.  The goal was $5 million but over $9 million was raised. The accreditor was unimpressed apparently and said: this was not enough. It’s like moving the standard higher when you hit the mark.  How does that work?  Now consider the for profit college accreditor which was removed by the prior administration  for failure to identify quality educational gaps in the institutions it oversaw and playing favorites.  Under the current administration, this decision is being reversed.  Does anyone see the irony, the inequity, the unfairness to small private non profits? Since when can we reverse decisions or move the goal posts with such ease?  I’m worried about small college accreditation.  You should too.  I am worried about for profit accreditation.  You should too.  Does the fact that Bennett is an HBCU cut against them?   Just asking if big corporate educators can crush small historic places that serve students not shareholders.

[/INST] Here's a lesson for leadership in a time of crisis:  When things go wrong, a leader needs to own the wrongs that have occurred.  It's easy to cast blame on others who held power in the past. But anyone holding a leadership position for more than a year or two has to take responsibility for current messes/mistakes. And, new leaders, this is hard and I know from experience and my own errors: you can only blame your predecessor and institutional bad acts for so long.  Once one gets the lay of the land, a leader owns the institution's past. Ownership is key to trustworthiness, the ability to live with oneself and to take real action.  Blame gets you nowhere. Why do I raise this now? With all the institutions struggling with one crisis or another, particularly in education, we can see the value of being forthright.  Stand up and own what went/is wrong. And, then take the steps needed to remedy the situation. Think Georgetown owning its slave past. Remarkable. Think Penn State not owning its silence. Troubling.  And, by the by, PR folks would agree: It's best for institutions moving forward if their leaders step forward.

[/INST] Former football player Rae Caruth is being released from prison.  He served 19 years. While in prison, he wrote this poem.  I wonder if we can get it to others who think about wrongdoing and the price we pay, and it also gives us insight into the feelings of immigrants and their children who are detained --- in their case, the only crime being seeking a new home without legal permission in most cases.  Hardly the equivalent of murder.   ""Carruth’s poem began: Think about how many times you’ve been to the zoo Ever wonder how it would feel if one of the animals were you? It ended: I bet you’ve never sensed the animals’ pain, humility or rage Because it’s impossible to conceive unless you’ve lived on both sides of the cage.""

[/INST] Please read and re-read this article (bravo to the men who participated) and respond to the notion I was told by one publication that the ""Kavanaugh"" issues are no longer a news peg. I beg to differ. These are issues affecting many, including in our schools, our colleges, our workplaces -- as students, teachers, faculty, staff, workers, administrators.  These issues are in a pot that is still cooking on a stove.  For sure and for real. The question, raised in the 5 part series I wrote on this, is how we can help schools, colleges and workplaces help their students.  See: InsideHigherEd (suggesting pop-up courses); New England Journal of Higher Ed (suggesting integration of issues/substance/knowledge into existing classes and hypervigilance); Forest of the Rain Productions and LinkedIn (pop-up courses for K-12), University Business (strategies for workplaces and culture shifts -- forthcoming), and a to be placed piece on how elite private schools can change their culture apropos of the ""Kavanaugh"" debacle.

It is a topic on which I will be writing when the saga reaches some sort of endpoint -- like a vote up or down.  It is too fluid a situation to write now.  But the issues will not cease their effect on people all over our nation. In the meanwhile, watch out for each other.

The debacle of yesterday -- and I missed the last hour --- will forever change how we view victims and those accused.  And we all know someone is lying. Both people who testified can't be truth tellers.  I know who I think is lying.  But, how people can obfuscate truth and play off emotions and act indignant -- professing that religion and religious schools carry righteousness in and of themselves -- is offensive no matter what.   I'd like to remind people that good folks can do bad things.  And bad people can do good things.  And, religion isn't like a vaccine -- religious people and doctors and teachers abuse children and when they do, those acts are buried and the victims' words discarded and truth is hard to find and even harder to address.   Everyone here can judge for themselves whether politics trumped truth.  That is my line for today: politics (whichever side you are on) trumped truth --- in every sense.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What if Judge Kavanaugh had been forthcoming about his younger years, including any parties or excesses, and had instead portrayed growth and self-awareness as he matured? [/INST] I just want to say as the sun rises, what if Judge Kavanaugh had told a diff story about his GT Prep HS/ Yale days.  Suppose he indicated that, given his background, he was overtaken by the freedoms before him and drank and partied too much and in over-the-top ways. He was like an unstuck drawer. As he's matured, he has seen how his behavior was misguided (how much vomiting does one need to experience), and he hopes that his own children can grow up in a way that does not require that level of rebellion to find their way.   Now assuming no sexual assaults in this period (a huge leap of faith for me as I believe the victims), he would not have lied. He wouldn't have had former classmates crawling out of the walls; he wouldn't have had his yrbk words to defend; he wouldn't have done a FOX interview (when winning, silence is better; when offense is weak, put up a loud defense). He wouldn't be discussing his virginity (or anything close to intercourse), and he would have been honest. I repeat: he would have been honest. Painting oneself as a saint is a surefire method for people coming to destroy that image. Who's a saint after all? Once you lie, the lies keep growing. That's, sadly, the story of a lying nominee. He exhibited poor lawyering too.

[/INST] Assuming Dr. Ford testifies, I want to know how we can get people on the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate truly to listen. Could we put our R/D affiliation in a drawer and just listen and hear?  If the point of a hearing is to hear, then prejudging and announcing one's vote ahead of time or that Judge Kavanaugh will be appointed misses the point of a hearing. And why plow ahead?  We plow fields not people. I get the rush but do we do justice by rushing to find truth? One more thought:  Youthful indiscretion is not rare. What is bad here is: failure to own one's past; failure to apologize; lying. The Justices decide about real people; truth matters.  Truly matters.  So does integrity.  So does honesty.  Judge Kavanaugh is not being criminally charged (too late); but he bears burden of persuasion.  This isn't about innocent until proven guilty in a criminal trial. There is no trial. There is a hearing on fitness and integrity. Worth distinguishing and remembering.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What are the often-overlooked benefits of small colleges, highlighting the positive impact they have on underrepresented communities and the diverse range of students and careers they serve? [/INST] A recent article in the Boston Globe described the struggles of small colleges and their likely collapse in the not too distant future. Sure, some will close but I have a different take. Here's a part of my response: As the former president for 8 plus yrs of one of the colleges referenced, I want to share a more optimistic take on small colleges, including the one I led with a remarkable team over the years.  I want to begin with three questions: (1) Whom do these colleges serve? (2) Are their graduates better for having attended and graduated (and even those who stopped out, are they better for the experience)? and (3) If not small colleges, where?    Ponder these questions/answers. Small colleges, non-elite small colleges, help many first generation, Pell eligible students find their way.  That's powerful in and of itself.  Small colleges have faculty who actually teach, and teaching and pedagogy matter to them.  Small colleges produce people who help make the world go round: police officers, nurses, community based workers, social workers, teachers, small entrepreneurs, radiology techs, healthcare advocates, coaches.  Returning to the article: You bet there is a place for small colleges.  I'd put money on it.  I believe.  My question is really: why don't you?

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What role can dual leadership models, such as co-presidencies, play in preventing and addressing campus sexual harassment, and what potential barriers might prevent such models from being implemented effectively? [/INST] So, an article appeared in Inside Higher Ed on why leaders are failing to stop sexual harassers/abuse/rape on their campuses.  Here was/is my answer: I think there are many reasons. 1st, try campus culture, an issue that runs wide and deep. So do traditions that encourage bad behavior. Look at Prep Schools as exemplars. 2nd, the ""hands-off"" leaders have real trouble; it's good to delegate but....And, there needs to be a culture of transparency and an overt culture where bad news can and must be shared, not buried. 3rd, there are rose colored glasses as in: this too will pass. Nope. It won't. 4th, much of the training is poor, and people resent needing training suggesting they know all the issues. Reform the training. Bring in outsiders to do it and make it worth the faculty, staff, coaches and administrators' time. Poor training leads to poor outcomes. And resentment about waste of time. 5th, how we handle crises when they occur on campuses is weak and needs reformation. We make things worse, not better, because we aren't experts. Bring them in. 6th, to return to my favorite topic: Ask this. If there were co-presidents, could all this happen as it did on all these campuses? Speculating yes. But, pretty confidently, I can say that co-presidencies would curb this.

[/INST] I just read this absolutely beautiful, honest and heart warming and heart wrenching piece written by the amazing Carrie Froese. It's titled the Magnitude of Motherhood.  Here's a link ( https://lnkd.in/d2SutnN ). Here's my response: What an absolutely beautiful piece. Heartwarming, heart wrenching and honest to its core.  I used to worry about my son dying -- for no particular reason. I just worried because life was and is filled with danger.  And, I could not imagine much worse fate than losing a child, except perhaps a child losing a parent when the child is young.  Now, my relationship with my adult son is strained for many reasons, some valid and others not.  But, as Mother's Day approaches I know this: there really is no love like a mother's for her child (or children).  And, one hopes that as a parent, one gives one's child both roots and wings as the saying goes.  And, one more thought on Mother's Day, for the children who don't have mothers or have mothers who don't care sufficiently or are psychologically absent:  don't despair. There may be no biological substitute but there are many of us more than willing to be ""parents"" or ""mentors"" or surrogate mothers if, as and when needed.  That's worth remembering too.

[/INST] So, after the fortune cookie message (glad many of you read about it), I am now starting Day 5. So far, I've had many realizations, some obvious; others less so. Here's a wee sampling: 1.  Nations may speak the same language (in this case English) but there remain remarkable cultural differences notwithstanding. And some terms are different too: Q-tips are cotton buds is a fun example.  Take Sunday. It is really a day of rest. Many stores and restaurants were closed on and off campus. A day of reflection. I see that cultural sensitivity is needed every minute.  2.  I am apparently hyper-sensitive to being an American given our politics and President. Case in point. I misplaced my hair brush in the move (small but impt. item). I decided a beauty salon was a good place to go to buy a replacement and found one a short car ride from campus.  When they rang up the charges, the brush was over $27 US. Trust me, it was not a fancy brush. I suggested something was wrong with the price and while they were re-assessing the price for me agreeing that it seemed high, I added: ""I may be an American but I am not stupid."" Really, I said that. Yipes. More as the stay progresses.  I am already seeing that the academic literature read across nations differs vastly.

I can assume you already it will include women writers and diverse writers and fiction including poetry.

I commend Carlton, an elite selective private college.  Good job and their president is wise (and I base this on personal experience with him too).   But, many non-elite small colleges have focused on careers for decades. The Chronicle seems to treat this as ""new.""  For decades, small non-elite colleges were criticized for not truly being liberal arts colleges because they also had a career focus in addition to a liberal arts curriculum and core.   Funny how the tables turn but the non-elites still get little recognition for decades of effort. Just as an example: consider nursing programs at liberal arts colleges.  Consider criminal justice degrees a liberal arts colleges.  Come on.  Let's give recognition where its due -- or overdue.

[/INST] Here is what is worrying me (among other things): recommendation letters. There is a history of such letters being written for teachers to get new positions despite the fact that these teachers have abused students.  We often are less than honest (if omission counts) when we write letters of recommendation.  We assume receivers of letters can read between the lines and know that we are not truly recommending someone but we are being cautious to avoid charges of defamation, libel and other legal risks.   So, posit this hypothetical: write a recommendation letter for Bill O'Reilly.  What should it say? Would all references to sexual abuse/harassment be absent from such a letter?  Ponder this conundrum; recommendation letters are commonplace.

[/INST] One question about Hillary and today's fainting issues. Why was she wearing long sleeves (and it looked like heavy fabric) in 80 plus degree humid weather amidst a crowd. Dark color too. I might have fainted also. Look what happened at US Open: players collapsed and came back. Some tried to continue while cramping.  Not sure where event exactly was at Ground Zero but I bet it was flat and low and heat capturing. Some people are just heat sensitive. Really.  Some people don't do well in heat. Light colors, short sleeves, carry water. Avoid unnecessary political brouhaha.

Their job was to do some fieldwork at a teahouse in the city. Blew me away.  Their commitment to the class makes me wonder how wonderful we would be in the US, if we gave more resources to schools across the board, more respect to teachers and more honor to students.

Smith, CEO of Vista Equity Partners, gave the ultimate gift to  #Morehouse  graduates—the promise to pay every cent of their student loans. It also gave people a sticker shock at the price of education and looming student debt crisis. Smith pledged to wipe out student loans estimating to be $40 million.

Though the act of Smith has been noted as a generous and bold philanthropic action, the numbers show the predicted next bubble.

But how much do you professionally trust a friend?  How close was this friend to your candidate?   What do you do if the process is discret? There’s no wrong or right answer.

One of the best tips I have for job seekers is to use friends and professional networks but, how to do it effectively? 1. Lookup for all of your 1st connections on LinkedIn, then organize them by- people that know you personally and can validate your work[from school, past companies, etc]  2.  Reach out to every one of these connections with a summary about yourself, what you are looking for, and ask them kindly to apply on your behalf to their companies. 3.  When they agree [Yay!], ask them to add a few words about your work together and to send it directly to the hiring manager. This has a lot of weight on the CV screening decision.  4.  When hiring managers have valid information about you from a friend they trust it and increases your chances to get hired. 5.  After passing the CV screening use your friend as your source of information about the company! Ask them about the culture, challenges, and projects, and prepare yourself for the phone screening! Just applying isn't enough these days, the game has changed and you need to do the best. #hr   #jobhuting   #linkedin   #recruitment

[/INST] Everyone is focused on the employee experience. What about the candidate experience? This was always tough. This new reality makes it even tougher. A lot of companies are trying to gain an advantage with ‘goods’ - mainly sending gifts to a candidates’ home. That’s not a bad effort. That makes candidates feel special. It will never replace the human touch. Candidates deal with uncertainty. Waiting for answers, getting feedback - these are their core challenges. It’s great to get a fruit basket or a bottle of wine, but it can’t come at the expense of being there - providing interview feedback, being available for questions, giving answers - reducing uncertainty. All employees were once candidates. Never forget that. #hr   #interview   #career   #people   #recruiting

[/INST] Want to make a shift?  Switch to a new position? Venture into a new field?  DO THE WORK. Listen - talk to someone. A real person who’s been doing what you seek to do for a few years.  Understand what it takes to do their job - skills, experience, education, talent. This can validate (or nullify) your decision to pursue it in the first place. Learn - show interest.  Listen to podcasts, connect to professional groups, read articles. Get acquainted with the jargon. Know to speak the right language. It takes time.  DO - start your own project in that field. A blog. A podcast. Volunteer somewhere. Do something. This will give you plenty to talk about in interviews.  This is a MUST.  Write - post on LinkedIn or in professional groups/forums with your thoughts. Share your approach online. Comment to industry leaders. Engage.  Motivation is great.  It’s not enough in today’s market.  Do the work to gain an edge.   Job search IS a job.

[/INST] Want a better chance at that job you want to get hired for? ‘Translate’ your CV to the language the company is using. Focus on 2 elements in your CV: Title - make sure your title fits the job description. If the job description lists ‘software engineer’, don’t use ‘Backend engineer’ in your CV. If there’s a way to get a perfect match, use it. Keywords - read the full job description. Find what matters in that job. And put as many keywords as possible in your CV.  Pro tip - So many companies are using bots to screen CV. So use the EXACT same words. Use spaces before and after. Don’t let the bots rule you out.  Whatever you do, DO NOT LIE. Especially in the skill section, you will be easily spotted during the interview phase. Once you get caught lying, there’s no turning back.  Does it take time to match your CV with different positions? Yes, it does.  Getting hired is a full-time job.  #people   #hr   #skills

The most popular one is “spray and pray” - sending your CVs to any position, regardless of how relevant it is for you. It can’t hurt, right? Wrong❌ Applying for every single job out there shows Recruiters that you lack focus, passion, and talent. Not very good qualities. Worse than that - sometimes you’ll get in the system, in which case you’ll be marked as someone who was rejected multiple times. So what should you do? 📌Research the company you want to work for. 📌Research the people who work there. 📌Find a RELEVANT job description, one that 📌you have a real shot at.  📌Research that position and try to talk to people in that company who know what it means 📌Adapt your CV to better reflect that position Then - apply✅ *This isn’t 2005 anymore* Invest time and effort, and the chances of finding your dream job will dramatically increase. #hr   #people   #linkedin

[/INST] Are you adding a message to the Recruiting person? You should, it’s worth the effort. If you do it right! The way you approach Recruiters is as important as your CV. There’s so much at stake.  Yet I still get pinged with messages that immediately disqualify the sender. Here’s how to do it: #DO : Personalize your response. Make it sound like it comes from you. Research. Give us a feeling you know what the company does, and how it relates to YOU. Be Polite. Mention any special ability you have that’s relevant. I’m always looking for a candidate with an edge.  End your message with a Call To Action. A simple ‘best regards’ isn’t enough.  #DON ’T: Use templates. I spot them immediately. Command us to do anything. You don’t work for me, I don’t work for you. Not yet at least :-) Ask us what we have to offer you. This is about offering yourself, not the opposite. Finding a job IS a job. Make the effort.   #hr   #people   #linkedin

On your LinkedIn profile, you’ll see the number of searches you appeared in.  Clicking on them gives you some handy insights. Where it shows the job-titles of the people, this indicates if you reach the right audience. Take a look at whose search you appeared in and see if those are the kinds of searches you want to be showing up in. If the people you are appearing to are unrelated to your field I would recommend seeing if you could make some adjustments to your profile to better align with the searches you want to show up in. As you can see, in my case: 📌People from AppsFlyer search my profile- Hi guys you can reach out to me over slack although I'm more available here😂 📌Most of the people work as SW developers- which is good for me because this is the audience I'm looking to hire. 📌The keywords people search for Sourcer, Recruiter, HR, and Talent are also amazing for me because this is the kind of words I want people to search and find me. So, take a deeper look and try to learn and improve. This is a great QA to your profile. I think a good number should be 300-500 searches🙏🏼 #linkedin   #jobs

Both posts were uploaded at the same hour, same picture and subject (You can check the numbers) and yet one of them gained much more exposure (post A).  My explanation is: • Post A is much more personal, I shared my personal goals, feelings and this is what people are looking to read. Tip- don't be afraid to share your feelings and thoughts, you will get much more exposure. • Post A tells a story, compared to post B which is super short and generic. Tip- tell a story and be a storyteller of your career, try to start with a problem and finish with how you solved it. • Post A ends with calling to action, a question.

[/INST] Let's talk DATA! I have exciting data about the industry, 3-months post corona. I will give my insights. The basis for the information is from  AdviceMe.Il   so of course, you can not generalize it to all populations. Nevertheless it's interesting. First - the average age of people who asked for our advice: 26-33. I can explain it mostly by experience, 26-33 usually are employees at the beginning of their careers, and companies prefer to keep the seniors because they're more expensive to hire and of course, more valuable. Second, 1 out of 5 people is a software developer! Well, I was amazed by this one. I would think that SW people who are in high demand would be the last to get fired. I can explain it with 2 ideas - first, most of them are juniors /from small startups that had to close, second, AdviceMe's branding was especially oriented for tech people. Another interesting piece of data- 80% of the people who asked for our advice had at least an undergrad degree. The higher education was the fewer people there were. I guess companies won't let go so fast of people with high education. Also, 90% of people with 3rd degree had a managerial experience which is not a surprise. I want to thank  Or Hazbani   for all his help and great insights. And, 3 months later, I'm back in the office!

Companies actually developed techniques and selling points in order to sell the positions based on these factors, and now we have a game-changer!  After some research on my side, I can tell that things are gonna change. Here are the new 4 key factors that will be considered in the post-corona era: **Financial stability of the company (the company fired staff during corona, or sent employees to unpaid leave) **Work-life balance (did the company take into consideration work hours for employees with kids, WFH)  **Social responsibility (companies that helped during the corona with donations, volunteering, and technology)  **A place to stay for the long term (according to salary, perks, and people).

He started to call the woman at one point ""the risk"" and the lesson was to mitigate risk in hiring.  His argument was that women are inherently risky investments, even when all the data shows otherwise.   This month, I kept thinking back to this one lesson in college, equating risk to women.

[/INST] When I was in college, I remember transitioning out of tech because I didn’t think I was smart enough.  I had tried out for a tech entrepreneurship club on campus, and in my 2nd round of interviews, choked up on a basic marketing question. I was so embarrassed that it eventually led me to questioning if I was tough enough for the industry.  Last week, I worked my first Demo Day as an official member of the  500 Startups  family.  If you would have told me when I was 18 that I would be creating content about some of the world’s most promising tech entrepreneurs, I would have thought you were crazy.

While I know of PayScale, Glassdoor, Paive, and others, I recently had a conversation with other women about the lack of resources at a Women in STEM “Tea en Blanc” event a couple weeks ago.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:How do you perceive the phrase ""strong independent woman"" and what does it reveal about the societal expectations surrounding women's characters and roles in the workplace? [/INST] I’ve always had a love/hate relationship with the phrase “strong independent woman”.  On one hand, it was used as a compliment. It was often used in conjunction to people saying I would make a great businesswoman.  On the other hand, it was also used as an insult. People would  use it in conjunction with statements like “she has too high of expectations” or “she definitely doesn’t care about being likable”.  I love Meryl Streep’s response to why she plays “strong-minded women”.  “No one has ever asked an actor [why they’re] playing a strong-minded man. We assume men are strong-minded, or have opinions. But a strong-minded woman is a different animal."" What do you think about the term?   #leadership   #femaleleaders

They often do things because they are told, and while many criticize them for this, I think it takes a ton of humility to know when you should work under someone and just learn.  2️⃣Many employees take that 9-5 to sustainably support others.

As a Gen Z-er, I focus on saving money as much as possible. But when I do spend, I spend it like a Millennial (i.e. on experiences).  I am sitting at a WorldZ session led by Viacom, and I can’t help but think about how weird it is to hear people of another generation name and define my generation.  As a marketer, I totally understand wanting to target audiences. But what I notice from these kinds of talks are the lack of Gen Z people in the room, contributing to the conversation about what they are like. I am so curious as to how the conversation about Gen Z will change once younger people start actively participating in the conversation.  #marketing   #genz   #millennials   #targetaudience   #generationaldifferences

And, I’ve had friends succeed and fail at turning their education into work opportunities. What I learned is that college isn’t for everyone, but the  University of Southern California  was the best option for me. People have different paths to success, and each has its own unique pros and cons.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What are the key differentiators that set highly successful community builders and entrepreneurs apart from others, and how can I define and build my own personal brand around the value I can bring? [/INST] Too many people don’t understand the value they bring.  “How do I go about making a strong personal brand?”  “How do I get noticed by employers/investors?” I was recently inspired by  Fabio Marrama 's and  Tiffany Parra 's posts on the value young people can bring and how to define that value.  There are so many of us that define our professional brand by the number of jobs or titles we’ve had. After interviewing community builders and successful entrepreneurs, it has become clear to me that it was not their title that made them confident. Instead, great leaders knew exactly how they changed the organization for the better. It’s one of the biggest reasons I tend to resent the “fake it till you make it” mentality.

[/INST] “'But nobody cares about my opinions,' they say. 'It would make me feel conspicuous.' 'They’ll care if you tell them something interesting,' I say 'and tell them in words that come naturally.'” - William Zinsser I've noticed that many people on LinkedIn feel like they don't have enough experience or expertise to start creating content. They leave it to this group of self-identified #LinkedInCreators as if the ""creators"" are the only ones able to give value to readers on the platform. I was reading Zinsser's On Writing Well for a class and found it incredibly relevant to why you shouldn't be afraid to put out LinkedIn content. While much of the platform's content can be technical, value doesn't have to come from verbose language and complicated analysis. Great content comes in many forms from many kinds of sources: students, CEOs, entry-level employees, stay-at-home parents, consultants, professors... I may be biased, but some of the best content I have seen is from my fellow students and young entrepreneurs. Check out some of my favorite people on LinkedIn who are creating real VALUE through their content and community building efforts.  -  Frederick Daso -  Tim Salau -  Tiara Conley -  Manu Goswami -  Sam Park -  Joel Hansen

[/INST] ""You don't need a great first job post-college. We're Millennials. We probably will never have the same job for more than a couple of years."" I was talking to an older friend about my anxiety around graduating this May.  The advice I got was a bit discouraging. While I understand my first full-time job won't make or break my career, I wondered why I, like many Millennials, was expected to probably never have a long career at a single company.  Everyone loves talking about Millennials, and many of us have been fed an idea of whom we are:  --> self-entitled --> tech-savvy --> job-hoppers I think some Millennials have accepted job-hopping as the only realistic option for our generation to like the work we do. I always hear: ""I mean, would you actually enjoy working for the same company your whole life?"" I don't know yet! But I do think we shouldn't just expect to job-hop. I hope I will, at the least, stay long enough to create real, sustainable value for the companies I serve and focus more on how much I contribute than the number of years I have spent at a company.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Will Remote Work Replace Traditional Office Environments Indefinitely? [/INST] Is Remote Work Here to Stay? It surely seems like it! Brynjolfsson, who studied intersection of technology & economy for years argues a few interesting points that are worth attention (link to the full NPR article is below):  1) There's a lot of inertia in the way people work and it's quite hard to change the processes, the culture, the training, and the types of work. Unless there's a “SHOCK”, most people will tend to continue to do things the old way. In fact, pandemic seems to be the shock needed to push the world to “remote work” almost overnight. 2) Based on data, there’s a Productivity J-Curve when companies adopt new technologies and processes. First, there will be dip in productivity; then with further investments, adjustments, and adoptions there will be significant gains. So there could be more benefits of remote work to come when as individuals, organizations, and industries we nail  #remotework . #futureofwork   #workingremotely   #productivity   https://lnkd.in/gC3n2Y5

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Compare the remote work strategies of Facebook, Twitter, and Square and share which one you think is more sound and effective for current employees and future hires. [/INST] Facebook  Remote Work Strategy vs.  Twitter  &  Square  Remote Work Strategy: Which one did you like better?  Twitter & Square announced that all employees have option to work permanently from home. Facebook announced that 50% of its employees will work from home over the next 5-10 years. In my view, Facebook's approach is a lot more sound and serves both current employees & future hires while still drive for the best business outcomes. Here's why?    1) Facebook acknowledge the gaps and plans to solve many of the issues such as communication & creativity through building tools & technologies.   2) Facebook plans to offer remote work to more experienced employees vs. newly graduates who need more mentoring and structure.   3) It offers Remote Work option to majority of current and future employees, but acknowledges that some roles can't be remote. It's critical to be honest and open about these types of limitations. 4) Facebook's strategy came across as data driven & feedback-driven -- based on the survey results from employees.  5) Facebook officially took a stand which enables it to establish leadership in this movement. Its decisive yet conservative approach came across as more well though out.  What do you think? #remotework   #workfromhome   #flexiblework   #futureofwork

The Gates Foundation, Wellcome & Mastercard are committing $125M in funding to companies developing treatments for the coronavirus.  4) Many companies that haven't been fully prepared to support  #WorkFromHome  needed to move to that direction. 5) Despite ""social distancing,"" the deep human connections will get stronger & our communities will hopefully continue get tighter.

Watching Chris in action as one of the top leaders at Citi & one of the most respected investors on the Street & in the world, taught me fundamental leadership lessons that I carried through my life:  1) As a leader, you should always keep calm & be in control of your emotions even during the most challenging times & while delivering tough news such as economic downturn of 2008 or a key executive’s departure. Teams will pick the leader’s emotions, which can help them to stay focused and confident or lose it all together. 2) Be intellectually curious. Get to know others on a personal level & always stay fun and interesting, so others care to get to know you.  3) Speak less, smile more & listen attentively. That way, when you talk and provide a point of view there’s a lot more receptivity for it.  Thanks Chris!

If not, who would sign up to do “hard things”, in this case Barry Bootcamp (those of you who have done it before can relate), 😁without a clear goal in mind?  3) Don’t settle to “status quo” or “your base” even though that’s comfortable. Always push for the next level!” Thanks Coach Paul! #newyearresolution   #newyearreaolutions   #fitness   #clearyourmind   #healthandfitness   #thoughtleadership   #motivateothers   #motivations   #winning   #leadership   #championofchange   #changeyourmindset   #bestcoaches

[/INST] When it comes to “business and product strategies” and picking the “winners” ONLY time will prove us right or wrong. My friends, colleagues, and peers many probably remember how bullish I was about Calm early days despite the head start that Headspace had in the mindfulness category. I had done a deep dive “product analysis” on both companies early days and despite the fact that both had great products, and that Headspace arguably had more modern design, I bet big on Calm due to some superior product experiences that Calm offered (e.g. flexibility to participate in multiple programs simultaneously, the quality and relevance of its contents). Calm from early on put users’ needs / constraints in the center of the product design and development and that’s why now they are #1 app in meditation, with over $1bn valuations, and people like LeBron behind the company.

She shared invaluable nuggets of wisdom here:   1) “When you’re a female, colored woman, immigrant serving as a CEO of a large company and undertaking a transformation, there are tons of critics,” she said. “All the time you were in the public eye trying to answer the critics. So it was a ""grind"" all the time.” 2) Much of women’s ability to succeed at home and at work depends on existing workplace systems, which are rife with unconscious bias that “attacks women’s confidence.” 3) “All CEOs should run the company for the duration of the company, not the duration of the CEO. My success should be judged on how well my successor does, not just how well I did."" Indra Nooyi  - Thank you for being such an inspiration and role model. Thank you for always keeping it real and candor which help open up larger conversations, enabling to shake the status quo.  #powerfulCEO   #femaleleadership   #worklifebalance

Although in the Western world we’re struggling for such rights as women, unfortunately in other parts of the world millions of women are still fighting for a lot more basic rights such as not being forced to marriage at young age, being raped to save their own/their families’ lives, to go to work or to school, or being able to drive. Today, I want to invite all of us (men & women) to be more aware of our own gender bias, to acknowledge women’s ideas the same way we value those of men’s, to not harshly judge women who are wearing multiple hats in families and society by none reasonable metrics, and to reach out and donate to organizations throughout the world that support women especially those help with education and prevent domestic violence, abuse, and human trafficking.

I have a few resolutions & goals. #1 in my list is to get back to daily meditation, the habit I built a few years ago, but lost it more recently due to being extremely busy. Wearing different hats every day as an executive, mom, wife, university lecturer, startup advisor & investor, public speaker, daughter, sister, and friend left me absolutely no time for myself.  As someone who researched mental health and the benefits of meditation closely, I know that committing to do 5-10 minutes of meditation every day will bring me the focus, calm, and clearance of mind that I need and make me more effective in everything I do. So my new year resolution is to get back to daily meditation. I want to invite you all to join me in this journey and share your experiences with me throughout the year. These are some tips on how to get started:  1) Allocate the same time every day to meditate. Ideally you meditate after an existing routine (e.g. right after you wake up). That’s the best way to build a habit. 2) Set a reminder.  3) Use one of the meditation apps - Calm or Headspace.   #health   #wellness   #meditation   #newyearresolution

[/INST] Recently, I see a few articles per week about shortcomings of Sheryl Sandberg. What bewildered me is that I don’t see as much criticism about the #1 executive, the male CEO & Founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg. He’s treated like a passive Chairman of Facebook at this critical times rather than the active CEO to whom Sheryl reports.  Rather than everyone focuses on the right issues, which are the technical, security, and communication problems at Facebook, they are mistakenly making the recent Facebook events about a Female Leader failure!!! Would we have the same coverages and bashing if Sheryl was Sean Sandberg! I strongly doubt... I’m sure that Sheryl made some mistakes along the way, but I can guarantee every single male and female executives make many mistakes over decades of running companies.  I can’t help but highlight that “these high power women” who take on tough roles get “substantially unproportionate fair share of blames” when things go wrong. We saw this in terms of Marrisa Mayer and we are seeing it with Sheryl Sandberg.  I really want to invite everyone from reporters to regulators to focus on the right problems and keeping the CEO more accountable or at least as equally responsible as other executives.  #leadership   #femaleleadership   #femaleexcutive   #facebook

Fascinating that the “daughter effect” seemed to lead the hire of more female partners. #venturecapital #diversity #diversityrecruitment #HBR

[/INST] Amazon's acquisition of PillPack is fascinating on multiple fronts:  1) It's one of the very few real success stories and unicorn exists of recent digital health companies. (sadly, many of the digital health companies don't have the right business model which hinder them from scaling). 2) Value creation of over $1Bn in only 5 years is so amazing and rare, especially for a business that deals with regulation and logistics (scaling Instagram is very different than scaling a drug delivery business).    3) Now with the scale of Amazon, it's interesting to see how the pharmacies will be disrupted by PillPack's offering. I guess $17.5 billion loss in market values of CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and a few others today is an indicator of what's ahead. #pillpack #acquisitions #pharmacy #digitalhealth

He was glad to do it as he lost his Mother 9 months through these changes. What are you planning to achieve or change in 2018? Where could you find triggers that deeply matter to you?  My big lifestyle change I aim to achieve is to get back to meditation. I used to do it and lost the practice due to super busy lifestyle. As someone who study and research these topics day in day out, I know getting that 10-20 minutes back for meditation every day will allow me to be more mindful, more effective, more productive, and more relaxed.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Write a heartfelt and honest essay expressing the struggles and feelings of healthcare workers battling PTSD, anxiety, and compassion fatigue during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for public support and recognition. [/INST] Healthcare Workers’ Parallel Pandemic: Chronic Stress It’s no surprise that  doctors and nurses who go to work in an active battle zone, will,  at some point, start to feel anxious, worried, and stressed. This battle combatant is a wildly contagious disease called COVID-19. Doctors, nurses, aides, medical techs, clerks, environmental service workers feel threatened for their lives by just doing their jobs. And it is not clear if Americans really appreciate the level of risk, exposure and selflessness that all medical workers do for all of us. When I worked in a busy inner-city ER, I felt rushed, stressed and at times, worried for my safety: every now and then, some patient would come after a nurse or doctor with a knife or gun. But in comparison to treating patients with COVID? No comparison—treating patients with a highly contagious disease and with patients that are really ill, is way, way harder. My heart goes out to all healthcare workers.  The way we can support healthcare workers is by masking-up and keeping our distance. Selected Except: “We put on our masks and come to work every day because we don’t have the luxury of working from home in our pajamas, but the apathy and ennui that’s taken hold of society just makes our job feel thankless. It’s so demoralizing.”

The tactic is similar to satyagraha (literally, ""truth-force"") which Mahatma Gandhi used in seeking independence from British India. It is never out-of-fashion to speak Truth to Power.  But as writer Noam Chomsky asserts: ""power knows the truth already, and is busy concealing is.”  It is the oppressed who need to hear the truth, not the oppressors. And who can argue with this?  As 2020 marched along and COVID-19 continued to worsen, all of us ‘regular’ people knew the virus was spreading and getting worse and yet, those charged with prioritizing fact, science and public wellness, buried the truth...And many more Americans are dead and sick because of it. As the promise of 2021 opens, I’m hopeful that we will have more transparency and more “Truth-Force” in managing the pandemic.

Good behavior with mask wearing and good citizenship are normal parts of my behavior when it comes to COVID-19, and it takes effort—I’ve got my many masks on me all the time, hand sanitizer handy. I’m weighing going (and not going) to stores, movies, not hugging friend, not going into their homes and on it goes. And I’ll keep doing all of these things but it is getting harder to do—I mean who doesn’t want to have a cozy meal with friends? I trust science and medicine—over the last 150 years, modern healthcare has done more to improve our lifespan than any other factors—clean water, clean sanitation, antibiotics, vaccinations, dental health, are the cornerstone to our collective health and why we now live past the age of 50.

[/INST] Creative Cascade at Scale  Certainly Covid-19 had been, on balance, very bad. It has, however, accelerated business goals and operations. Even in ways not planned before...like moving AA / NA meetings all virtual. Even though online rehab rose as an emergency stopgap measure, people in the field say it is likely to become a permanent part of the way substance abuse is treated.  And it turns out that ‘online’ is a highly effective tool to treat patients with behavioral health issues too. Being able to find a meeting to log into 24/7 has welcome advantages for people who lack transportation, are ill, juggling parenting or work challenges that make an in-person meeting tough on a given day and may help keep them more seamlessly connected to a support network If not for Covid, the “creative exploration” of online meetings would still have happened but much more slowly. I’m glad to finally see healthcare adopt more creative solutions, and I hope we continue to see more ‘creative cascades.’ But moving forward I sincerely hope it doesn’t another pandemic

[/INST] Old-and-New Fangled Ways Help Thwart Suicides These are tricky times for sure, but it seems times have been difficult for awhile for many, if you view suicide rates as a direct expression of ‘difficult times.’ For more than a decade, health officials have watched in vain as suicide rates climbed steadily — by 30 percent nationally since 2000. Doctors have traditionally gauged patients’ risks by looking at past mental health diagnoses and incidents of substance abuse, and by drawing on experience and medical instinct. But doctors and mental health experts can’t crack the code when it comes to identifying which patients are in real danger. Turns out that AI programs explore more factors and allow healthcare professionals to identify more at-risk patients. Very good news indeed. But identify people is only half the equation...the other half—arguably the most critical half—is who is most likely to profit from an intervention...and be open to the help. Reaching people to communicate that they are not alone nor misunderstood, can happen whether the old fashioned ways or new-fangled ways... The critical element is to reach people...using AI and other predictive capabilities certainly can help reach more people and is the finest use of technology that I can contemplate.

Nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists do not study hard, take exams and dedicate their lives to caring for others just to be mistreated, disrespected and not listened to by patients. I’ll say this again: healthcare professionals do not have to take care of sick people —they can refuse to care for a patient or stop working all together.  Our healthcare providers are becoming burned out and bummed out. Healthcare professionals receive profound satisfaction from taking care of patients. However, they too have limits and nothing rubs caregivers the wrong way more than patients who don’t show personal accountability for their actions and behaviors. “They tell you there must be another reason (besides COVID) they are sick. They call you names and ask why you have to wear all that ‘stuff’ because they don’t have covid because it’s not real. Yes. This really happens.”  “These people really think this isn’t going to happen to them. And then they stop yelling at you when they get intubated.” As my mother used to say: “It’s good to have an open mind but not so open that your brains fall out.” Amen

Read This News About Blood Pressure Turns out there are “three B’s” we should focus on when we think about our heart health: Blood pressure, Blood glucose (sugars), and Blood cholesterol. People with high blood pressure are also more likely to have higher cholesterol and blood glucose levels. And this is important because heart issues still kill many more Americans than other diseases. Recent studies have found that for every 10 mm increase in systolic blood pressure, the risk of calcium deposits and cardiovascular events rose accordingly. The ideal strategy for optimal health is to focus on all risk factors — blood cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure.  This might be boring but it’s important: Maintaining a healthful diet, exercising, not smoking and consuming alcohol only in moderation is good for your heart health.

 Studies show that they help us lower our blood pressure and deal with stress. But we don’t need studies to tell us what we know already! Dogs also help us get more exercise and spend more time in nature. They always love us and they are always happy to see us. In some ways, dogs show us what ‘goodness’ looks like in all of us too!
 
 Due to the ongoing pandemic, there has been an onslaught of negative news that can cause us to get mired in the spiral of depressing articles. However, it seems that a spike in dog adoptions during COVID-19 is one positive outcome that we can feel good about, as adoptions increased significantly in March and April. 
 
 So if you have a dog, or cat, or are thinking of adopting, make sure you have the  time--and love in your heart—to commit to them…Like they will commit to you.

And when it comes to healthcare, VIPs get the best treatment, doctors, therapies and monitoring. ‘VIP-ness’ is a feature of American medicine.

Anxious? Can’t Sleep? Here’s a Prescription For You. Some doctors, nurses and therapists have been prescribing laughter to help people get through this seemingly never-ending pandemic, wild fires, unemployment, and political division.. Stress and anxiety are very real health concerns and magnifies the risk of  heart attacks and strokes. Medical studies confirm that those who tend to laugh more have a lower risk of major cardiovascular illness.  Possessing a healthy sense of humor is also associated with living longer—and having more fun while being alive! So try to bring a little more laughter into your daily life—perhaps watch a few videos of pets being silly, or children playing in a puddle of water—anything that helps you laugh! Having a good sense of humor is an excellent way to relieve stress and anxiety and bring back a sense of normalcy during these turbulent times.

[/INST] Anger as a Poison Anger is a trickster—it starts out like a warm hug, providing immediate reassuring feedback. But keep it around too long, and it becomes a toxin that circulates in the bloodstream, poisoning all organs and causing self-loathing and irrational hatred for others.  Trust me I’ve been down this destructive road. At first, and for some months, the hatred provided a sense of ‘righteousness’ and ‘rightfullness.’ But I only became more and more irritable and dark.  So it goes with all hate—the hater turns to loathing of everything and everyone.  It’s critical to turn your back on anger because nothing positive comes from it. One way to do that is by breathing slow and regular, and by mentally pinpointing the ‘core nut’ of what is causing the anxiety or anger. Once the core nut is identified then mentally think through how to address that problem in your own life—not how to solve the problem flat-out.  Life gets better with less worry, anxiety and hate.

But even as hospitals in cities like New York City and Detroit have been deluged with coronavirus patients, many rural facilities now have the opposite problem: their beds are near-empty, their operating rooms are silent, and they're bleeding cash. During these very irregular times, and unlike ‘normal,’ many hospitals are seeing way less patients than normal. Either because people are fearful of going to them for fear of catching  COVID-19, or also because all elective (non-urgent) surgeries and other procedures have been postponed. More than 150 hospitals and hospital systems around the country have already furloughed tens of thousands of employees. One reason why rural hospitals in some states have shut more hospitals than others: The states that refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act program have seen more hospital closures. Meanwhile, the pandemic has made it even harder for already financially vulnerable rural hospitals to survive. I’d be very sad if my local hospital closed. Especially if I worked there—

From somewhere deep in his apartment, Adam Sandler’s mind is summarizing why we all love these healthcare workers—and it’s because they humanly, calmly, do the daily work of ‘saving lives and stamping out disease.’  Saving lives and stamping out disease is what my doctor-father would say every day after work, when I’d ask him ‘How was work Dad?’ My father’s steady, no-ego approach to medical practice, and hearing stories over dinner about treating patients, formed my opinion (at a very young age) that healthcare and science were the most important careers one could have. This has been true for my entire life and it’s even truer now: all healthcare workers and those doing ‘first response’ work are our National Treasures. If you want to put a smile on your face, watch the video of Adam Sandler singing high praise to our doctors and nurses!

[/INST] A Few of My Favorite Things In the midst of this (hopefully) once in a lifetime pandemic, there are,surprisingly, loads of good-news stories including: -The story of the oft-shunned African migrants in Italy helping provide fresh vegetables to...Italians! —The story of a low-income-serving grocery store owner, giving away groceries to all his customers...and he plans to do it again. Why? Because he said, ‘It’s the right thing to do.’ —Many local stories of people sharing their bottled water, TP and other items with total strangers. —Stories of families singing together. Friends connecting virtually and neighbors helping neighbors like never before. This gives me hope and a warm heart.  That said, in my ‘Least Favorite’ column, there are still states that do not require ‘shelter-in-place,’ and churches encouraging large crowds of people.  Here’s the thing about diseases and viruses specifically: they are equal-opportunity infectious agents. If they had personalities, you’d find them to be non-partisan, non-sexist, non-racist, non-religious, non-anything. They love everything and everybody. And that’s the problem.  So let’s get more good stories of people (and leaders) being smart about social distancing and less stories of people believing they can rise above this virus.

Perhaps my mood swings are due to a generalized uncertainty or because I feel that too few of our leaders are acting with confidence and facts. But I’ve found a tonic to my ills and his name is Dr.Fauci. And that is because he represents Science and Facts. And in these times, science and facts are the true messengers and Dr. Fauci and other medical professionals and researchers are helping us understand the viruses’ language. They are the people who represent hope, grace and goodness.  In times like these, we need to be singing from the same sheet music listening to only one conductor—think of it like this: We are all in the Pandemic Choir and Dr. Fauci is our conductor. Any one who wants to harm him (for whatever crazy reason), harms all of us.  There is no choir without him and people like him. Without science and facts leading the choir, we will devolve into a bunch of hyenas howling on our own rooftops.

[/INST] Why Followership is More Important than Leadership. With everything going on (you know what I mean...) there seems to be an uptick on advice on Leading or Leadership. Topics like  ‘How to be a Good/Great Leader During Times Like These’ is everywhere.  Helpful thoughts certainly but I’d suggest what is really needed right now is advice on ‘How to be a Great Follower,’ and ‘what Does Followership Look Like in Times Like These.’  First off, without Followers, Leaders fail. Leaders without Followers are either phonies, extremists or untrustworthy.  The role of Followers is not talked about enough. Followers alone are responsible for the success of Leaders. Without followers there are no leaders. For any project or organization to succeed, there must be strong, ethical people who willingly and effectively follow.  In these times—and in the context of Global Public Health Uncertainty—Followers uphold moral, cultural and community rule-of-laws. We are the Effector Arms and Legs of all the right and correct actions that must be taken. But it means honoring social distancing. But it also means considering  our neighbors and community members by not hoarding or becoming rude, disrespectful or unethical. So go and do the right thing...And as my Dad would say, ‘Stay Out of Trouble.’

[/INST] Sloppy—and dangerous—Care is What Our Seniors are Getting. In recent years, the federal government has been ramping up the standards for nursing homes, but inspectors remain frustrated by the prevalence of sloppy or nonexistent handwashing.  4 in 10 nursing homes have been cited for an infection-control lapse. And these are at the ‘5 Star’ places. Workers are not washing their hands as they moved to the next patient, or failing to don masks, gloves and gowns when in the rooms of contagious patients in isolation. Why? Many of the nursing homes are privately owned or backed by for-profit owners who cut staff and pay low wages. So it’s hard to get well trained, dedicated staff. In my opinion nothing is more ugly than a country that abandons their responsibility for it’s aging citizenry.  Ensuring patients are safely cared for in a dignified manner is all of our responsibility. As family members visiting nursing homes you should ask the aides if they’ve washed their hands prior to touching your loved one.  Hand washing is the Number One best activity to prevent the spread of Infection so ask about it every single time anyone walks into a room. I’m dead serious.

Researchers scored  participants on the American Heart Association’s seven measures of heart health: blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, physical activity, diet, body mass index and smoking. They scored better than their non-dog participants! Dog owners were more likely to report sufficient physical activity, a better diet and good glucose levels than the rest of the group.

Doctors, nurses, hospital administrators, risk managers, technicians and other dedicated health care staff who work diligently to help patients in their medical care, recovery and illness, work in a health care organization.  And running one of those organizations is hard work—patients and families rely on those people to be dedicated, accurate , evidenced-based, accountable and compassionate.

Many of the problems at this hospital are similar to problems found at other hospitals that have specialized programs, including perhaps the biggest issue: not treating enough patients per year (or case volume) to develop the needed medical expertise to reliably get safe patient outcomes. Reaching adequate case volumes to keep up skills is a challenge because so many hospitals are competing for patients — these programs are an important driver of profits, so hospitals want to keep them going.

Two reasons: firstly, cubicles and open spaces are noisy, distracting and communal-encouraging “drop-in” meetings and interruptions.

Neurodivergence describes the variations in the ways our brains function, and encompasses people on the autism spectrum and people with ADHD or dyslexia.

Which is great news if you live some distance from your doctor or from a quality hospital—or even if you live ‘downtown Anywhere!’ Why drive or take the train when you can just dial-up your doctor or specialist? In a Friday afternoon announcement, CMS said new rules will eliminate geographical restrictions on telehealth access and telemedicine services in MA plans by 2020, enabling those in urban areas to use connected health technology. The changes will also give Medicare Advantage members more locations to access care, including their own home. Expect private insurance to follow (since they always do...)

[/INST] Trust. What does that word even mean anymore? Rules. Doesn’t anyone respect them anymore? If you can’t trust Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute to uphold the absolute highest ethical standards in cancer treatment, then what’s a clinician to do? When your “star doctor” lies about taking money from drug companies and breaks the rules regarding disclosure, and you pay him $1.5M a year to be your “face” of cancer care, then what’s that say about the Hospital? Believe me or not, but Healthcare—all the way to its core of using science and evidence in the medical treatment of patient guidelines—is corrupted by big pharma, device manufacturers and for-profit incentives to physicians (and hospitals). It breaks my clinical heart every time I read a story like this. Selected Excerpt: “...One of the world’s top breast cancer doctors failed to disclose millions of dollars in payments from drug and health care companies in recent years, omitting his financial ties from dozens of research articles in prestigious publications... ...He put a positive spin on the results of two Roche-sponsored clinical trials that many others considered disappointments, without disclosing his relationship to the company. Since 2014, he has received more than $3 million from Roche in consulting fees...”

It’s when a drug is prescribed for other reasons than what it’s ‘officially’ made for.  “Off-label"" means the medication is being used in a manner not specified in the FDA's approved packaging label, or insert. Every prescription drug marketed in the U.S. carries an individual, FDA-approved label. Selected Excerpts: The F.D.A. had data showing that so-called off-label prescribing was widespread. But officials did little to intervene... ...The F.D.A. established a distribution oversight program in 2011 to curb inappropriate use of the dangerous medications, but entrusted enforcement to a group of pharmaceutical companies that make and sell the drugs.. ...pharmaceutical companies “actively subverting” the oversight and safety process... ...the pharmaceutical company pleaded guilty and paid more than $600 million in fines related to misleading marketing... ..drug companies have faced legal action for falsely advertising medications and have  paid over $400 million in fines... “It is not open for debate that the risk of these drugs among patients  is unacceptably high.

Medical errors are things like getting the wrong medication, being prescribed the wrong test, being diagnosed with the wrong problem. And it’s a huge problem as it is the 3rd leading cause of death. Medical errors happen for many, many reasons including doctors and nurses being tired, distracted, forgetful or simply out-of-date with best practices.  Only one of the  issues with medical errors is burn out. Lets face it, the bigger problem is that people are faulty instruments when it comes to high reliability, consistency and memory. That’s why I’m hopeful about technology-assisting advancements such as ‘smart’ (meaning automated) order sets, Smart radiological readings for x-rays, and ‘early warning’ technologies that diagnose medical conditions before they’ve advanced, just to name a few. The time is coming when the scope of what doctors do is narrower and more augmented by advanced capabilities. We should embrace this because honestly, right now, Healthcare is a very dangerous place for patients.

So while the biotech and digital health industries might be getting more “sunlight “ for what it can do to help our health care systems, good old fashion “boring yet basic” health improvement takes the winners circle for realizing great patient benefits without breaking the bank. Selected Excerpt : “Food-insecure adults are two to three times more likely to have diabetes than adults who are food secure. And food insecurity is widespread; more than one in eight American adults and one in six children is food insecure. People with severely limited incomes often turn to inexpensive, easily accessible food that is rich in calories and poor in nutrients, which can cause and exacerbate diabetes.”

Which means feeling physically fit, 'light' and well, happy. I've started, stopped and re-started working-out too many times to count over the 40 years I've been exercising. Here's what I've learned: 1. Re-Set To Zero: Know you will start, stop and need to re-start exercising many, many times. I think of this as 'resetting to zero.'  2. Get into the Work-Out Mindset: Be kind to yourself and set winning 'goals' at the beginning of your 'work-out season.'  3. Feel Successful Each Time You Work-Out: It’s about the process of ‘doing’ so applaud yourself for ‘doing’ rather than judging ‘how much or how little’ you did. 4. Figure Out ‘Why’ You Want To Exercise: This becomes important to staying fit. 5. Develop a Personal Matra: By coming up with a ‘saying’ that you can repeat to yourself when you are working-out, that helps a lot. When I used to train for marathons, I would repeat to myself ‘The Mind Gives Out Before The Body.’  This is a good, comprehensive article on tips, ideas, strategies to help everyone start—or continue along their healthcare journey.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:""As healthcare costs continue to rise, can introducing a system where patients are charged the actual cost of procedures have unintended consequences on access and quality, with proponents arguing it could lead to 'pay to shop' in healthcare."" [/INST] In Health Care, Price does NOT Equal Quality, so Shop Around! Sometimes the high cost of a lab test or procedure is simply based on being able to get away with it. Historically (and still) what something costs and what you get charged for, is hidden to the patient. But because patients are increasingly responsible for a portion of their own bill and because health insurers want to manage costs and influence behavior with their members, we are seeing changes. ...perhaps this is the start of “pay to shop” in healthcare. Selected Excerpts: “At the request of Kaiser Health News, Healthcare Bluebook ran some sample numbers for a Northern Virginia ZIP code, finding the cost of a colonoscopy ranged from $670 to $6,240, while a knee arthroscopy ranged from $1,959 to $20,241. These are not crazy ideas,” said David Asch, professor of medicine, medical ethics and health policy at the Penn Medicine Center for Health Care Innovation in Philadelphia. But it’s hard to get consumers to change behavior — and curbing health care spending is an even bigger tasks.”

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Discuss the disparity in gun violence statistics and outcomes based on the type of gun used, explaining how differences in velocity and energy between guns can impact lethality. [/INST] What trauma doctors and nurses know ...the issue is NOT guns, but rather it’s the type of gun that will kill you. Just like how all viruses do not pack the same “killing punch,” it’s the same for guns. Years ago I worked in an inner-city trauma center and saw gun shot victims every shift. And you know what? Most lived. But that was before there were many high velocity weapons used in the streets. Just like viruses differ in their ability to inflict morbidity so does the “strain” or type of gun. Selected Excerpt from The Atlantic: “Routine handgun injuries leave entry and exit wounds and linear tracks through the victim’s body that are roughly the size of the bullet. If the bullet does not directly hit something crucial like the heart or the aorta, and the victim does not bleed to death before being transported to our care at the trauma center, chances are that we can save him. The bullets fired by an AR-15 are different: They travel at a higher velocity and are far more lethal than routine bullets fired from a handgun. The damage they cause is a function of the energy they impart as they pass through the body. A typical AR-15 bullet leaves the barrel traveling almost three times faster than—and imparting more than three times the energy of—a typical 9mm bullet from a handgun.”

[/INST] Reducing patient quality of care: Why are we going back in time? Many of us don't have the time (or inclination) to follow every maneuver occurring regarding changes to the ACA. This article talks about a really important aspect of the ACA which is linking physician and hospital payment to quality measures--meaning payment models which rewards better care and outcomes for us, the patients...Rather than linking payment to doctors for simply doing things--regardless of quality or outcomes for us, the patient. As someone who specializes in organization safety and quality of care--and as a patient--these roll-backs concern me....as they should you as well. Selected Excerpt: “Clearly a great big foot has been put on the brake,” said Donald Crane, the chief executive of CAPG, a group of doctors and hospital administrators that, unlike many in the profession, has pushed to tie physician pay to quality measures rather than the old model of fee for service.

A.I. contributing to longevity medicine: Finally it's not only about medications related to ageing but also about how A.I. can help bring healthcare to patients better.    An imaginative scenario about a critical care physician at a medium-sized urban hospital who has to implement an A.I. coming from a local start-up that claims to automatically interpret chest X-rays.    While treating breast cancer, physicians use a quick, inexpensive tumor-tissue stain test to diagnose the illness and a slower, more costly one to determine treatment. A new study just presented a neural network that could help. The stain in the test for treatment highlights a key visual clue to the choice of therapy that’s otherwise invisible to human pathologists. Researchers built it to detect that clue in the diagnostic test.    The question of who should get access to COVID-19 vaccines first has varied from state to state in the US too, with some governments prioritizing those with high-risk conditions and others lowering the age of eligibility. Sanford Health is using a machine learning model to identify which individuals are at greatest risk of having severe COVID-19 outcomes.

[/INST] I've done 50 keynotes in the last 6 months so I’m reflecting a bit on what keynotes will be like in the new “never normal”. My take so far: Virtual keynotes don’t work at large expos with 1,000s of people and exhibitors. At such events, we’d like to immerse ourselves in a different world. We’d like to see and experience the venue, thus bringing such events to a single screen (with break-out rooms or not) is a complete waste. Whereas it’s not worth organizing events in the physical space with 150 attendees or less. I believe these won’t be coming back and I’d strongly agree there’s no need.  I can’t wait to hop on a plane for large-scale events all over the world, but I’ll be happy to continue giving smaller keynotes from the comfort and professionality of my new studio: it’s cozier, it creates a more honest environment and I even get better questions!

Assessment of a client’s strengths and difficulties and designing interventions are simply made by algorithms and the authors assume that psychologists are just there to share the results of the machine. Such narratives are not only false but even dangerous. If healthcare professionals (wrongly) think that advanced technology is here to replace them, they will reject those even more.

In my book, “My Health Upgraded”, I’m sharing the most exciting questions (and providing answers) about the future of medicine. In the upcoming month, I’ll share with you one question from my book each week and provide a short (but sweet) answer. Question 4: Is Printing Out Medical Equipment Cheaper Than Manufacturing?  In short: YES. And not only that, it’s much more customizable. 3D printing works by additive manufacturing, which means that a digital model is created of the object we want to print out, and the machine adds each layer one at a time. That way, a personalized, 3D printed cast could get ready in 2 minutes and would cost around $50.  Wealthy companies will turn to 3D printing because of its potential for total customization. Companies in poorer regions will turn to it because it makes prototypes inexpensively.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What key aspects of the future of healthcare and medical technology can be gauged from recent research and patient expectations on the importance of human touch and empathy in the digital age? [/INST] Attention. Time. Empathy: 3 essential things e-patients expect from healthcare and medical professionals. These are also the fundamental values of healthcare, which seem to stay with us infinitely. Our interviews have shown that cooperation between technology and healthcare is not enough on its own: the most decisive factor is the return of the human touch and reciprocal communication.  All of these suggest that technology is an important ally in the ‘renaissance of medicine’ that starts to treat patients as it should have always had. Our vision is to be able to provide this for patients in the future, while being surrounded with cutting edge, invisible technology.  This publication backs up our vision, feel free to read our research and findings!  #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology

[/INST] Today is strong in A.I. in healthcare news - here’s my short summary: 1) IBM Algorithm To Tell Who’s Going To Get Alzheimer’s By Reading Their Writing The essence of it would be to be able to signal a diagnosis in advance from a type of data format that’s easy to procure:  2) Microsoft A.I. Chatbots To Revive Dead People I simply can’t consider these as good ideas. Would you care to prove me wrong? If the experience isn’t very similar to having your loved one nearby, it’s a huge disappointment. Whereas if it’s exactly so, well, that’s the ultimate uncanny valley:  https://lnkd.in/e-qQGPx 3) A.I. Predicts Asymptomatic Carriers of COVID It may seem strange that an algorithm could predict how likely someone is an asymptomatic carrier of COVID, based on their movement and GPS position thanks to knowing the places of most infections. However, it’s crucial to be able to identify them, as they’re the ones spreading the virus the most efficiently (and unknowingly, of course).  https://lnkd.in/eYDt9bp #themedicalfuturist

[/INST] 1 in 4 men and 1 in 5 women have hypertension worldwide, estimates the WHO.  As for the most common arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation (AFib), it affects some 33.5 million individuals globally; with its prevalence expected to double by 2030. These cardiovascular conditions need regular monitoring so as to prevent severe complications. Gathering multiple cardiovascular readings from a single device makes a lot of sense. I’ve recently tested the   Viatom  Armfit+ which can do exactly this, and I found that it gives accurate results extremely fast.

[/INST] Bias in A.I. might be the biggest challenge ahead in making A.I.-based technology truly useful for medical purposes.  But there’s a new paper in Nature Medicine that proposes to train algorithms to become better at predicting patient outcomes rather than to match the performance of their human counterparts. The paper presents this theory through a real-life example. Decades ago, a system was developed on white, British patients to determine their level of knee pain based on certain radiographic features of their X-ray.  This system systematically scores black patients far below the severity of pain that they self-report. When they trained a deep-learning model to predict the patient’s self-reported pain level from their knee X-ray without using data from the old system, they found that the model was much more accurate, especially for black patients, thereby reducing the racial disparity.

[/INST] I started testing this pulse oximeter and will come back with the findings next week. The oxygen levels in the blood of COVID-19 patients can drop to dangerously low levels without them noticing, also known as ""silent hypoxia"". As a result, patients have been arriving in hospital in far worse health than they realised and, in some cases, too late for effective treatment. A pulse oximeter allows patients to monitor their oxygen levels at home, and costs about £20. #pulseoximeter   #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #COVID19   #COVID_19   #coronavirus

Experts need education, talent and the ability to communicate their talent, as well as peer appreciation. But all this is not enough anymore.

And since in a democracy everyone’s entitled to their own opinions, as an expert, you’re stuck with trying to transmit your knowledge and expert opinion. It has a truly crippling effect on informed debates on any number of issues.

So the question is not whether we should do this but how we can do it in a way that protects what is valuable and vulnerable.  📖 Read my full analysis in our eBook with The Medical Futurist to understand, anticipate and control your privacy in the era of digital health:  https://lnkd.in/eqKzMx4   #privacy   #healthdata   #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #book   #reading   #read   #ebook

Morgan  Chase, got crashed as Haven was just announced to end its operations at the end of February. What it means for us in digital health: * Big money alone cannot break into the healthcare business as they simply lack the expertise, experience and knowledge about the regulatory environment (among other things). What it doesn't mean for us: * That tech companies will still play a major role in the future of care with the products they can bring to the table (instead of creating a different form of healthcare like Haven attempted).

If any vaccine gets left behind because of a no-show, a volunteer can go and get that shot, thus minimizing wasted vaccines.  If I worked at a hospital, I’d run to grab my vaccine TODAY.

[/INST] My last book recommendation for 2020: Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by  Susan Cain . The book describes how the 20th century was for the good-looking extroverts, the ‘sales’ types of people.  Whereas the 21st century is all about the introverts: the Bill Gateses and Elon Musks, the Big Bang Theory genius geeks.  However, the future is for “the mix”.  It made me note both the introvert and extrovert personality traits I have: I’m very introvert in my life, in disliking social events, when I’m immersed in reading, even when driving a car (no radio or podcast on, just complete silence). Whereas I also feel amazing when giving a keynote to 1,000 people.  Without going too much into the scientific reasoning behind this (read the book for more details!) What's important is that we should do our best to balance our introvert and extrovert personality traits to make them collaborate rather than conflict with each other. Have you read this book?

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:How will the digitalization of healthcare impact bedside communication and patient relations among medical professionals, and what strategies should professionals adopt to successfully navigate this transformed clinical landscape? [/INST] ‘Webside’ instead of bedside: a new, digital way of communicating with patients. I keep highlighting the need for a cultural transformation in healthcare to catch up with the digital transformation (rapidly accelerated by COVID-19).  Kaiser Permanente’s new curriculum is a wonderful example: instead of only teaching students the necessary bedside communication skills that each medical professional learns, they now integrate the “webside” manner. They want to prepare students for a clinical practice likely to be far more virtual than ever before, as there’ll be less bedside visits and shaking hands, and more virtual interactions. Still, communication and creating a connection with patients is such a key element of medicine, and since digital communication is something different, it needs to be learnt.  Well done!

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Which COVID-19 vaccine should one choose based on reputable scientific evidence rather than political influence or marketing efforts? [/INST] Which vaccine will I want to get? This is one of the questions I get the most. In the UK, the first 130,000 people got vaccinated against COVID-19. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine just got approved in the US, and we’re waiting for the authorization of the Moderna vaccine as well. I expect to get the vaccine around May as luckily I’m not considered to be part of the high risk category. So what’s my answer? I’ll get the vaccine about which I can read a study. Since I see the studies for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna, I could choose either.  Whereas I don’t see any for either the Russian or the Chinese vaccine. A decision about a vaccine should never, ever be about which political power is communicating about it louder than others.  It has to be a competent pharma company with a study, peer reviewed and published in a medical journal, approved by a regulatory agency. We all understand the rush and the pressure, but despite all this, medical clinical evidence is a must. And I stand by this forever. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #COVID19   #COVID_19   #coronavirus

[/INST] I’d like to honor the unsung heroes of healthcare: nurses. This week, I’m focusing on how digital health will transform the nursing profession as well.  As being a nurse requires the core of what makes us human – paying attention, being empathetic and caring -, it will never be replaced by technology.  However, technological innovations can relieve nurses of the burden of many monotonous and repetitive tasks.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Explore how the integration of Artificial Intelligence in the medical field could lead to a revival of the 'art' of medicine, where data and technology drive quality care rather than burnout and administrative tasks. [/INST] A.I. will bring the real era of the art of medicine. We all know that the art of medicine requires attention, time, and empathy from physicians while they are treating patients. Whereas currently, lots of administrative tasks need to be handled, and there’s a constant pressure from payers impacting physicians. Thus even the chance for the art of medicine vanishes.  However, the use of artificial intelligence could help facilitate it. Using advanced technologies, medical professionals will be able to care for their patients better, and their challenge will not be in finding out how to do it but instead to understand why certain methods work and others do not.  As an example: Imagine that A.I. will come up with a drug combination that works, and a medical professional needs to figure out why and how it came up with it.

I exercise at least 15 times a month, sometimes 18.  - I’ve lost weight and now weigh 78-9 kg, which means a 24.1 BMI.

Normally, breast cancer detection by looking at mammograms is done by two doctors, one of which they switched to A.I.  They worked side-by-side for 7 years, and the outcome? No significant change with the results, and that’s what we’re looking for here. Researchers concluded that using Mia together with one human reader could help to address the radiology workforce crisis in breast screening, and provide a solution for dealing with the backlog of cases due to COVID-19.   #mia   #breastcancerdetection   #mammograms   #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #deeplearning   #machinelearning

[/INST] Here we go again: Big words in the headline while the study was retrospective. A study from Northwestern University concludes that DeepCOVID-XR, an A.I. algorithm they’ve developed, detected COVID-19 on chest X-rays with performance similar to a consensus of experienced thoracic radiologists. However, when you look into the details, you see it was trained on data retrospectively.  Whereas a physician diagnoses and treats a patient real-time, and doing that retrospectively would yield very different results and efficiency. I think study authors should only compare an algorithm's performance to that of physicians if both used the same method to diagnose or treat, prospectively. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #deeplearning   #machinelearning

[/INST] Interrupted sleep is terrible! Interrupted sleep while being in a hospital can straightaway slow your recovery. Now an artificial intelligence based algorithm can help avoid that. Many patients get woken up at night or at dawn to have their blood pressure measured or blood tested. When all they should be doing is to rest.  Researchers of this paper mean to avoid these unnecessary overnight monitoring, using a clinically based deep learning model. They’ve checked millions of data from a multi-hospital health system to train an algorithm that creates an early morning patient score: this shows who are those patients that really need to be woken up due to a risky condition. Their result? From 10,000 cases, the algorithm was wrong only 2 times.  This is exactly the kind of clinical problem where we need to start A.I. research and implementation. This is so very convincing that it could enable the adoption of artificial intelligence in other areas as well.  #deeplearning   #research   #hospitalcare   #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #machinelearning

[/INST] A Day in our Lives in 2045 - How Will Health and Wellbeing Change? 🧘 Healthcare’s been fundamentally changing: the use of health sensors, genomic data, artificial narrow intelligence, and other advanced technologies have become commonplace over the years.  The same will happen to well-being. How are we going to wake up, consume our morning breakfast, exercise and arrive to work?

Read my story: * I was among the first to order the new Fitbit Sense in August. * They couldn’t find my order for 2 months then confirmed to have lost it. * I spent ~4 hours with customer support. * They offered me free shipping if I placed the order again but it would cost around 30% more. * Even though it’s unfair, they don’t seem to care or will do anything.  It’s simply the worst experience I’ve had since Google acquired them and I won’t buy any more products from them. Why is this especially sad?  * I used to be a true brand ambassador: * I’ve had about 10 Fitbit trackers from the very beginning (since 2009) * I always highlighted that it was the first device to include a smart sleep alarm, the Holy Grail of health tracking * I continuously spread the word and many bought Fitbit products because of that My suggestions for improvement: Fix your customer service 🙏🏻 Getting a tracker is a matter of trust and without proper customer service, there can be none.

[/INST] Far the most cited paper of  The Medical Futurist Institute  in recent years is this one: The role of artificial intelligence in precision medicine. It describes that through the cultural transformation called digital health, the hierarchy of traditional medicine is transforming into an equal-level partnership between patients and caregivers. Besides many disruptive technologies, A.I. has the biggest potential to support this transition by analyzing the vast amounts of data patients and healthcare institutions record in every moment. By taking away the repetitive parts of a physician’s job, it might lead to being able to spend more precious time with their patients, improving the human touch. However, A.I. can only fulfil its mission if it remains a safe, efficient, and proven aid in treating patients and improving healthcare. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #TMFI   #research

Sepsis Watch is the product of three and a half years of development (which included digitizing health records, analyzing 32 million data points, and designing a simple interface in the form of an iPad app).  It scores patients on an hourly basis for their likelihood of developing sepsis (when an infection triggers full-body inflammation and causes organs to shut down). It then flags those who are medium or high risk and those who already meet the criteria. Once a doctor confirms the diagnosis, the patients get immediate attention. It has dramatically reduced sepsis-induced patient deaths and is now part of a federally registered clinical trial expected to share its results in 2021. #healthcare   #aihealthcare   #digitalhealth   #artificialintelligence

We aimed to explore the digitally engaged physician’s knowledge and attitudes towards digital health technologies and the transformation of the doctor-patient relationship. We did this by doing qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 11 digitally engaged physicians from 9 countries.  We asked them about the role of digital health and technology in the medical practice and their everyday challenges, the ideal physician-patient relationship, and skills and competencies needed for working with e-patients and visions about the future of the medical practice. The interviewed physicians state that digital health solutions could create a deeper doctor-patient relationship: knowledgeable patients are a huge help in the joint work effort and technology is the main tool for creating a more involved and responsible patient.  Medical professionals in the future might rather get a role as a translator between technical data and the patient; as a guide in the jungle of digital health. However, the interviewed physicians also noted that digital transition today is more beneficial to patients than to their doctors. #digitalhealth   #futureofhealthcare   #study

[/INST] While I write often about the limitations of artificial intelligence and what it can really offer in practice today, sometimes I come across developments in A.I. that not only blow my mind away but also depict an exciting vision of the future of healthcare. Look at this: In some cases, patients need injections with an iodine-based dye (radiocontrast) to make their organs more visible in scans. But some patients can’t take the dye. So researchers developed a GAN (generative adversarial network) that generates labeled, undyed CT images of lesions on kidneys, spleens, and livers. They added these images to real-world training data to improve performance of a segmentation model that marks lesions in diagnostic scans. As it's really hard to get enough quality medical data to train the algorithm on and labeled medical data is even harder to find, GANs are making it easier and less expensive to create large, annotated datasets for training A.I. diagnostic tools.   #artificialintelligence   #ai   #aihealthcare   #digitalhealth   #futureofhealthcare   #themedicalfuturist

It’s quite like having a basic checkup at the optometrist right at home! We just tried the VisionCheck to get our EyeGlass Numbers which are similar to lens prescriptions. By attaching the device to your phone with an included rubber band, you can measure the refractive error of each eye by performing 9 visual tests on each eye through the companion app. These tests revolve around using the touch controls on the device to align colored bars on-screen. It’s quite user-friendly and there’s a helpful audio guide throughout the process. You won’t get the most accurate result at first (as the app mentions), but with more vision tests and less deviations obtained from the readings, you’ll get a more accurate EyeGlass Number.

Moreover, digital health IS NOT health IT. We published a whole paper about the differences and the Gary-rule that can help anyone make the distinction easily.  https://lnkd.in/g2UvetW #healthcare   #digitalhealth   #healthIT

The US government’s largest national health insurance plan decided to reimburse hospitals for the use of a deep learning model that spots signs of stroke so patients can receive time-critical treatment (up to $1,040 per patient for each use).

""Viz LVO classifies blocked blood vessels in CT scans of the brain with 90 percent accuracy. When it identifies a potential stroke victim, it automatically notifies a specialist to review the case, bypassing the usual radiologist review.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Despite the potential benefits of digital health tools, the term ""virtual care"" may be alienating and misrepresenting the actual nature of care, highlighting the need for a broader examination of how to improve care in general, rather than focusing solely on the differences between virtual and in-person models. [/INST] Accenture released a report based on a survey that around 2000 participants filled out in the US. They conclude that before COVID-19, growth in consumer digital health adoption had stalled. While the cohort is small and only US-based, I understand the criticism around digital health tools and services. My main concern is that they call it virtual care. I have a great relationship with my GP, and when I share some data with her about a potential health issue and she helps via digital communication, I don't feel that it's different from when she attends me in person. Digital health in the eyes of its users and medical professionals will always look like something that doesn't want to work, while the solution's been here all along: whether you provide care in person or by using a way of digital communication, it's just care. Stop calling it virtual care, stop alienating this from everyday medicine and accept that digital health will bring a cultural transformation. This is the new norm where the use of technologies is inevitable in caring for patients. This misconceptualization derails the whole study. Instead of emphasizing the differences between virtual and in-person care, it should examine ways to improve care in general. And that question is independent from technologies.

[/INST] I asked Dr.  Ádám Schmidt  to test  StethoMe® , the A.I.-enabled digital stethoscope in his pediatrician practice, and here are his observations: ""StethoMe is probably a dream device for parents and for doctors to follow up on pulmonary and cardiac diseases. The device is portable, mostly for home use, is sleek and has no buttons to confuse the user. The StethoMe app gives the user comprehensive advice on what and how to do during the examination. The auscultation is recorded with the device and sent via Bluetooth to the phone app, which uploads it to the cloud and is analyzed by the StethoMe AI algorithm. It can be time-consuming and difficult to complete a good enough examination, especially when a child is crying. The StethoMe AI algorithm can’t filter the surrounding noise, and the device itself is quite loud too - because of that, home use can be tricky. Overall, I like the device and find it useful. It can be used at home to decide on the status of your patient. I find it very useful that you can record and play back previous recordings, creating a timeline of data to monitor the evolution of the disease. As an addition, with this function it is easier to teach medical students and educate patients. Looking forward to the progression of the device."" #DigitalHealth

Enabling an early detection of Type 2 diabetes with just a smartphone. - How do you expect the field of biomarkers to change based on studies like yours? Digital biomarkers are easy and low cost to measure and have a potential to allow early detection of diseases that would otherwise not be possible. One of the main problems with Type 2 diabetes is late diagnosis. Our algorithm will help catch this chronic disease faster. - Do you think that the hardware of a general smartphone would be enough to add insights to diabetes management? Absolutely. The hardware with this capability is available since 2014 on iPhone, and lately more and more and more Android devices are getting this capability. #DigitalHealth   #DigitalBiomarkers   #T2D   #Diabetes

[/INST] Being digital and portable doesn't guarantee that a device will be useful. I usually show services and devices that I heartily recommend, but now here's a friendly warning about gadgets you should be cautious about - they might be just (digital) dog and pony shows! 1. Calorie count from photos. You take a photo of your food and the app tells you the nutrients it contains. It's not even accurate when you weigh portions of your food and add those to an app like MyFitnessPal, so imagine how accurate those could be, using only photos. 2. Cheap tools to measure heart rate and sleep quality. If you want to take your tracking endeavors up a notch, you can't succeed with a single app or device just above the very basic level. 3. Pulse oximetry apps. You can install them for free on your phone, but unfortunately they are inaccurate - even studies show. 4. Genetic ancestry tests. It's thrilling to take one. But don't try to gain any medical insights from it. And definitely don't try to prove anything with it at your visa application. 5. Multifunction devices that can measure your vital signs, earthquakes, and the mood of your family. Maybe even killing mosquitoes. If something sounds too good to be true, it is. Which  #DigitalHealth  service didn't live up to its promises for you?

Apps that regularly remind you to drink water to avoid dehydration: You might be surprised, but I don't think we need a device for every drop of fluid, every blink, and every breath we take. But, challenge me if you know any concrete cases one needs a ding-ding for each glass of water. Wearable patches that measure sun exposure and notify the user when they are about to get sunburnt: I haven't seen that in practice - as far as I know,  L'Oréal  only came out with it as a pilot.

And most importantly, it has to reduce pain. I just tested Reliefheat, a device that promises exactly these. This is my experience with it: - The belt is easy to use, comfortable and portable. - The device operates on an app where you can set the basic features via Bluetooth. It heats and changes temperature in seconds and even learns your preferences. Charging is quick and battery life is long. - But: you need to figure out first if heat works for you or not. Everyone reacts to the same treatment differently. Heat might alleviate your muscle and joint problems, but for inflammation you should stick with something cold. - ReliefHeat is designed for the lower back area and although I tried to use it on other body parts, like knees and shoulders, it didn’t work out well and was uncomfortable. - The product is only available in the US and Canada. All in all, ReliefHeat delivered on its promises. If I had chronic back pain that reacted to heat, it would be an instant buy. But if the pain is elsewhere, or heat did not make you feel better, I would recommend you finding another option.

[/INST] This is a great illustration of how significant the cultural transformation with digital health is. Lancet Digital Health published an editorial addressing the issue of race to end health inequalities. They stated that racial and gender bias represent a significant problem in digital health, and even digital health approaches have contributed to these disparities by not considering race or ethnicity. ""For example, melanoma diagnostic apps trained on images of white skin have difficulty detecting cancerous skin lesions in darker skin. Even failing to sufficiently account for variables that are correlated with race, such as health-care expenditure, can create a wedge between health needs and care received. When race clearly plays a causative role in health outcomes it should be incorporated into digital health approaches to prevent bias."" And here, at pointing to a serious flaw, science stopped so far. What practical ideas would you give us and Lancet to fight racial injustice in digital health? We, at  The Medical Futurist , support these efforts, and I hope that we could come up with relevant analyses or research soon.

Some of those functions are subject to FDA’s regulatory oversight as medical devices, while others are not. I read the whole thing so you don't have to. When they regulate a medical device, the so-called ""other functions"" may jeopardize the cybersecurity, reliability or accuracy of the device. So they want to make sure that those other functions are also regulated, and the industry is aware of the dangers and risks so the FDA can have a better oversight over such devices too. As technologies get more advanced with artificial intelligence-based analysis, using smartphones or other connected devices, it was time to address this so patients and medical professionals can still use such technologies with trust. The best example they mention at the end is about a smartphone app that detects skin cancer from photos of suspicious lesions of moles. They describe that the quality of the photo a phone camera can make significantly shapes the outcome of the analysis. The manufacturer of the app should document how the camera impacts their app's accuracy. Excellent step forward! #FDAregulation   #HealthcareRegulation

[/INST] After  OpenAI  released its first commercial product - a rentable version of a text generation tool - recently, I've seen examples that point to a world where we people will constantly struggle to find out who we are talking to: a person or a bot. It can be so sophisticated, so human-like that we will develop common techniques we will share with each other that help determine whether the entity at the end of the communication line is indeed a robot. Just look at the conversation the bot had with a person about his holiday plans (image below). It's been used to write music lyrics, poems, news articles and many more. I first talked with a chatbot named Eugene in 2015 and it amazed me how it tried to trick me into thinking it was a person. I remember giving it a math test about apples and it asked whether I really wanted to talk about apples. When companies like Woebot offer chatbots for dealing with COVID-19 and related mental health issues, it's particularly important for these chatbots to function properly. Otherwise, they can do a lot of damage. In short: get prepared to bots tricking you into thinking they are human. https://lnkd.in/ejY7VCB #AI   #chatbot   #DigitalHealth

[/INST] Researchers at the University of Tübingen tried to train an A.I. to learn to identify a specific fish called tench on pictures. When they looked into the A.I. to see how it tries to identify that fish, they found out that the  #AI  was looking for human fingers against a green background as most of the tench photos in the training data featured a fisherman holding the fish in their hands after catching it. Can you imagine how useful it would be in medicine to point out such things before an algorithm is developed? This way, we could avoid so many false negatives, false positives and bias built into the algorithms. For example, radiologists looked at the ChestXray14 dataset of X-ray images and discovered that many of the images of patients with pneumothorax had a chest drain on the image as treatment already started when doing the X-ray. A  #MachineLearning  algorithm tasked with identifying X-rays of pneumothorax would probably look for the drain in the images as a perfect sign of the condition (they have to perform as well as humans would do, not learn to diagnose the condition), this way, missing patients with the condition who have not been treated yet. Can you think of an example in your practice (medical or not) where such subtle observations exist?

[/INST] There is an excellent new study that focuses on the intersection between medical A.I. and human trust. It describes very simply why both over and under trust represent barriers in adopting A.I.-based medical technologies. If you have over trust, you accept whatever decisions the A.I. would make without questioning that (and that's never a healthy option). If you under trust it, you'll need a lot of unnecessary resources to deal with its decisions as you will want to re-check everything. They conclude that: 1) The efficacy of human-A.I. collaboration is not only about the underlying mathematical process behind the A.I. system but also human factors, including trust. 2) Recent approvals of A.I. algorithms reveal the limitations of existing regulatory standards (at The Medical Futurist Institute, we have a study coming out about this soon). They also mention that the increased patient involvement in a patient-centered healthcare model changes the status quo.

[/INST] I just came across a great paper describing the difference between anonymization vs pseudonymization. Both represent important methods for protecting the privacy of patients whose data take part in studies and are analyzed by artificial intelligence. Currently, these are the most widely used privacy preservation techniques for medical datasets: 1) Anonymization is the removal of private data from a medical record. Simply, they delete parts of data such as name, gender or age. 2) Pseudonymization is the replacement of sensitive entries with artificially generated ones. They simply replace data such as name, gender or age with synthetic ones. It's harder than it sounds. Interestingly, the paper concludes that ""De-identification by naive anonymization or pseudonymization alone must therefore be viewed as a technically insufficient measure against identity inference.""

The company Muse has been the leader in this space, but no matter how much work they have put into their device, signal strength is an issue due to the nature of measuring EEG.

Now  Brainlink International, Inc.  was kind enough to send their device to me. Their headset has a relaxation and a focus training component too. I plan to test both, but obviously, I'm much more interested in the focus training. I used to test the  NeuroSky  headset with a drone so when I reached a certain level of focus, the drone started flying around. There is no drone now, but there is definitely a place on the market for a focus training, EEG-based device. I'll keep you posted. (My face? This is what I look like when I'm about to meditate with a headset.) #EEG   #EEGdevice   #EEGheadset   #MentalHealth   #DigitalHealth

[/INST] Finally, the results of Verily's Project Baseline Health Study are out! The study's original purpose was to build the world's most comprehensive omics database of people and their medical conditions to discover new insights, create new hypotheses about how these different systems are interrelated and lead to developing diseases. They collected almost every kind of health parameters, vital signs, physical examinations, and biomarkers. From radiology imaging to pregnancy tests, from psychological evaluations to data from sleep and fitness sensors several times over the course of the study. While going through the details of how they designed the data collection process, how they will make the data available to researchers worldwide, and what they expect from these, I could only think of artificial intelligence.  No human being will be able to oversee that much data, that many layers and systems. This is the future of healthcare research, and we will be doomed without A.I. And, it's a brilliant example of why you should stay in the loop with A.I.'s capabilities in healthcare!

My favorite part was when authors Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis describe what you could do to survive a robot apocalypse. They came up with quite surprising pieces of advice. 1) Close your doors and lock them: robots cannot open mechanical doors. 2) Paint your doorknob black because robots cannot see against a black background. 3) Go upstairs. Most robots cannot climb the stairs. 4) If none of these work, hop on a table and wait. Its battery will soon run out. These are humorous but true recommendations. They show how long the path is ahead for robots and automation to catch up with what we can do.

Nagendran et al. analyzed the design, reporting standards, risk of bias and claims of studies comparing the performance of diagnostic deep learning algorithms for medical imaging with that of expert physicians. There is a line in their paper that should be on the wall of every company involved with medical A.I.: ""The danger is that public and commercial appetite for healthcare AI outpaces the development of a rigorous evidence base to support this comparatively young field."" They could only find about a dozen studies and pointed out how many studies are not prospective and have not been validated on real world data. Their results stand as a proof that while the field is new and just started to skyrocket, the same rules must apply to them as to any other medical technologies, no matter how exciting A.I. results sound.

Even the WHO put together a brief on mental health considerations during COVID-19, with tailored messages not only to caregivers, but also to the general public. Of course, digital health companies also joined in the efforts. UK-based startup UnMind provides a platform for workplace mental health, Headspace is specializing in meditation, while Big Health offers a digital sleep improvement program to help overcome poor sleep without pills.

I find it fascinating when research groups can combine these three things: 1) a disease that affects a lot of patients 2) a device that is already in our hands, our smartphone 3) artificial intelligence making use of the data we can capture with it Here is an excerpt: ""We blindly tested this mobile sickle cell detection method using blood smears from 96 unique patients (including 32 SCD patients) that were imaged by our smartphone microscope, and achieved ~98% accuracy, with an area-under-the-curve of 0.998. With its high accuracy, this mobile and cost-effective method has the potential to be used as a screening tool for SCD and other blood cell disorders in resource-limited settings."" https://lnkd.in/dd8WBSf #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #deeplearning   #machinelearning   #sicklecelldisease

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:How is artificial intelligence revolutionizing radiology and making healthcare faster and more efficient through innovative medical imaging technologies? [/INST] Artificial intelligence has been enjoying a boom in certain medical specialties and radiology always stands out. There is an interesting story in MIT Tech Review about what A.I. is capable of in imaging. Rizwan Malik, radiologist at the Royal Bolton Hospital, turned to A.I. to make his job easier. In his hospital, patients often had to wait six hours or more for a specialist to look at their x-rays. If an emergency room doctor could get an initial reading from an A.I.-based tool, it could dramatically shrink that wait time. A specialist could follow up the A.I. system’s reading later. So last year, Malik identified a promising A.I.-based chest x-ray system called qXR from  Qure.ai  and proposed to test the system over six months. As COVID-19 jumped into our lives, they also had to re-design the system that now is capable of identifying coronavirus-specific signs. Such a fast response and iteration is only possible in the case of A.I.-based medical technologies. This is why it's so crucial that the FDA, for example, started analyzing companies instead of individual algorithms for approval. Also, there are so many COVID-19 related ongoing A.I. projects in medical imaging, that Stanford started to curate many:  https://lnkd.in/gE_rdhP #themedicalfuturist   #AI

Giving virtual keynotes seems to be the new norm and I definitely learn new tricks: * People sitting in their homes are much more comfortable asking challenging questions and appreciate being challenged more than in person * Talking into a camera is just so inhuman - as many people tend to turn off their cameras while listening to a talk (understandably), you basically talk to a camera with passion * As my team controls every technical detail, the opportunities for sharing spectacular content and a range of content types are just endless More to come as all my keynotes are shifting to the virtual space. Interesting times. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #fromchancetochoice   #speaker   #keynote   #speakerlife

It aimed at reviewing and critically appraising reports of prediction models for 1) diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, 2) for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and 3) for detecting people in the general population at risk of being admitted to hospital for covid-19-related pneumonia. It's quite devastating what it found and clearly shows why implementing A.I. into the clinical practice is going to be so hard without evidence-based data. They found that the proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Only one study used patient data from outside of China.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Describe how the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of 'digital health' technologies, turning a crisis into a transformative moment for healthcare innovation. [/INST] A note for those who don't understand why we had to shut the world down for this pandemic. This new virus led to a significant death toll in weeks, there are no treatment protocols, or thousands of peer-reviewed studies, no experience and knowledge in textbooks. Therefore, we had to shut down the world to let the medical workforce do its best until they can deal with it. Without the lockdowns, there would be peaks of cases in the span of days, leading to tens of millions of avoidable deaths, an overwhelmed medical workforce, and even mroe uncertainty about when we can go back to our lives. All this turns out to be a moment for  #digitalhealth  to shine. Telemedicine has become the norm in many countries to avoid exposure to infections. 3D printing technologies help support the broken supply chains of medical and protective equipment. Chatbots help those who face mental health challenges. Artificial intelligence helps prepare for the spread of the virus, reorganize supplies and help prioritize patients at higher risk for a severe disease. Apps all over the digital health specturm assist those who stay at home and still try to live a healthy lifestyle. As the pandemic passes, and it will, I hope the openness for these technologies will remain with us forever. #covid19

It makes sense to be vigilant and to know about the potential privacy issues and dangers that come with the use of A.I., but at the same time, let's have no doubt that we won't be able to tackle the next pandmic without implementing A.I. way before it appears. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #fromchancetochoice   #COVID19   #COVID_19   #coronavirus   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #deeplearning   #machinelearning

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Are anonymized COVID-19 location data sets released through Google Analytics' location history posing a risk to user privacy or being a necessary tool in the fight against the pandemic? [/INST] Google started releasing anonymized location data from users who have the ""Location History"" setting enabled in their Google accounts. This way, public health officials can see how effective social distancing measures are in 131 countries. The announcement mentions that Google isn't releasing any data on individual people or specific locations. Instead, ""it used differential privacy techniques to add noise to the data sets used to create the reports in an effort to make it harder to de-anonymize that data used to create the reports."" It means it's possible to deanonymize data, in theory, even though the risk is small. I'm so glad such huge data sets can support the fight against the pandemic, but we have to be vigilant so beating the pandemic doesn't come with the loss of our privacy. I deactivated the location history in my account years ago, but I'll now reactivate it until the pandemic is over. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #fromchancetochoice   #COVID19   #COVID_19   #coronavirus   #google   #locationhistory   #virustracking   #privacy

[/INST] In this video, I speculate how COVID-19 will end based on the analyses of public health experts. I also discuss what it would mean for us and how different it will be going back to our life which is not going to be the same. Also, a few interesting news and developments. Reporters at STAT News tested several chatbots that were specifically designed for answering patients' questions whether they have the coronavirus and the results varied greatly. With the same symptoms, they got different results such as there is probably no risk and start at-home quarantine immediately.  There are A.I.-based technologies that could make contact tracing much faster (it usually takes days) and could send a warning to people's phones who have been in the proximity of a patient who was just testedt positive. While it would significantly help the fight against the pandemic, it would also be a privvacy nightmare.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What if antibodies become a requirement for everyday life after a pandemic, forcing governments to implement a system of biological passports and immunity checks for people to safely reintegrate into society? [/INST] The FDA just approved an antibody-based test for COVID-19 which raises interesting issues. Those patients who are infected with the virus produce antibodies specific to the virus and such tests can detect them. This would show who has already been sick — whether they had symptoms or not — and therefore, who is probably immune enough to the virus to safely move around.  It doesn't mean the test is helpful during the pandemic but it could be useful when we try to go back to living our lives and doing our jobs. I'm just speculating here: What if the pandemic goes on for many months from now even with the worldwide lockdowns and only those people would be allowed to reduce social distancing (to work, do shopping, travel, etc.) who has a positive antibody test and a negative virus test (a PCR test showing there is no coronavirus in their body)? What if biotech companies have to create a sort of biological passport so some people can go back to society?

It also serves as a repository of solutions medical professionals can use worldwide. Just look at the myriad of Facebook groups and Twitter hashtags that connect the maker community to those in need.  Second, it overwhelmes us with information that is hard to digest and causes anxiety. Just think about how our lives will change after that. Let's say officials open up the lockdowns and curfews. People will not rush the streets ad buy air tickets immediately. It will take months to regain our trust in the world and its safety. What you can do is to point out reliable resources such as the map dashboard from Johns Hopkins or official sites from WHO or CDC, and direct people who are anxious there. You can help digest the news and look for consensus when it comes to questions like ""Shall I wear a mask if I have no symptoms"".

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Have you noticed any significant time reductions in emergency department wait times through innovative matching algorithms like the one used by Maple for Health PEI researchers understand the impact of such technology adoption in emergency medicine [/INST] I just came across a company called Maple that developed a virtual care program that tries to reduce the burden on the staff in emergency departments. They are piloting it with  Health PEI , a governmental organization.   Some patients who meet the program’s specific inclusion and exclusion criteria can use a virtual care visit right on the spot, instead of waiting for in-person treatment. The nursing staff under medical directives can perform a few tests, then add data about the patient on the online platform. This request goes out to a network of physicians using an Uber-like matching approach and physicians determine if they’d like to “pick up the visit” and treat the patient.  They reported an incredible drop in waiting times - down from 8 hours in some cases to under 5 minutes because of their matching algorithm and triage approach. I know there are many emergency physicians here.

To make it worse, smartphone users spend an average of two to four hours per day hunched over their phones - putting as much stress on their spines as having an 8-year-old sitting around their necks. It might sound paradoxical that digital health technologies can also help raise awareness and improve on such bad habits. However, trying Lumo Lift - a device that alerts you when you slouch - was a way less annoying experience for me than I thought first, and it really helped me pay attention to my posture. If not this, what do you do to prevent ""text neck""? https://lnkd.in/dKqmxqC #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #wearable   #health   #healthy   #fromchancetochoice   #posture   #textneck   #ergonomy

[/INST] I recently shared that because of my high genetic risk for skin cancer, I get regular check-ups by a dermatologist, plus I also re-check the risky spots once a month with  SkinVision . You cannot imagine the flow of negative comments I received after that. A week later, a review concluded that current algorithm-based smartphone apps cannot be relied on to detect all cases of melanoma or other skin cancers. Exactly! This is why I don't only rely on them. I use them to re-check spots. I also asked Skinvision to comment on the study and got this from Erik de Heus, CEO, SkinVision. ""The latest research, not included in the authors' overall assessment, proves that our algorithm can detect 95% of cases of skin cancer. In comparison, the sensitivity of general practitioners ranges from 61% and 66%, while the sensitivity of dermatologists is between 75% and 92%. SkinVision has assisted in finding over 40,000 cases of skin cancer already. These objective facts prove that the clinical benefits of the service outweigh the risks."" Digital health technologies take time to be proven + these technologies only assist current medical procedures. Skinvision could simply win this battle by having a similar study result that was not supported by them. Where do you stand on this?

[/INST] The FDA just approved the first drug to treat 4-17 years old children having peanut allergies. It's designed to minimize the incidence and severity of a child's allergic reaction to peanuts. In the US, 2.5% of children have peanut allergy, but millions of people are affected worldwide. For some, eating food containing peanut - whether denied by clueless waiters or mislabelled on the package - can even be lethal. So when I say that sensors indicating whether a food has peanut can be very useful, I mean literally life-saving. In this category, I tested  Nima Labs 's sensor (they also have one for gluten), and it does the task flawlessly - if you put a small sample of food in it, it indicates peanut accurately, is truly easy and fast to use, and it's portable. The only flip side is that you have to change capsules for each sampling, which is neither economical nor environmentally friendly. So, at the moment, it's not without fault - but neither is the newly approved treatment.

[/INST] Another excellent example of how A.I.-based systems could help improve healthcare. On January 9, the WHO notified the public of a flu-like outbreak in China. But a Canadian health monitoring platform,  BlueDot Inc  , sent word of the outbreak to its customers on December 31. It uses an AI-driven algorithm that scours foreign-language news reports, animal and plant disease networks, airline ticketing data and official proclamations to give its clients advance warning to avoid danger zones like Wuhan. It also correctly predicted that the virus would jump from Wuhan to Bangkok, Seoul, Taipei, and Tokyo in the days following its initial appearance. There is so much data that even the most experienced experts are not able to deal with it or see everything while these algorithms can filter through the mess of information. I hope governments and global organizations will take advantage of them. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #deeplearning   #machinelearning   #wuhan   #coronavirus   #epidemics

Even the head of Google Health UK said that such algorithms support the job of physicians, not replace them. So please don't believe the hype when you read the headlines such as A.I. outperforms physicians in diagnosing a medical condition.  1) These usually take place on pre-selected data sets, and clinical life is much more diverse than that.  2) Many of these studies are retrospective and still have to prove the efficiency of the algorithm prospectively. Just one of the reasons why I have a keynote narrative entirely dedicated to understanding A.I. from the medical and healthcare perspective. Those working with A.I. algorithms must understand at least the basics and it is indeed possible without any prior knowledge. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #fromchancetochoice   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #mammography   #googlehealth   #speaker   #speakerlife   #keynotespeaker

This is just the least extreme example of how technology will be embedded in sex and sexuality not so far from now - read our predictions: #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #fromchancetochoice   #robotics   #robots   #sexuality

A bit of a context: it's not surprising that by September in 2019, there are already more medical studies mentioning machine or deep learning than in 2018.  It was also expected that oncology, pathology and radiology stand out when it comes to using A.I. methods in medicine. However, I was surprised to see so many studies in psychiatry, surgery and neurology while you don't see discussions, news and announcements about those developments often. At the same time, it seems that cardiology, ophthalmology and dermatology, the specialties with the most exciting news and developments seem to be underrepresented.

[/INST] It was really hard to track down the developers of Leela Chess Zero, the highest rated chess engine today, but I managed to find them in a developer forum. It was interesting to learn that the developers are not professional chess players and they don't even need to be to develop such an algorithm.  Imagine the same in medicine. Developers creating the highest rated medical algorithm without having a profound knowledge of medicine. This is the era artificial intelligence is bringing to us. Here is how they described the algorithm works: ""Leela Chess uses a neural network trained without human knowledge. The training procedure uses reinforcement learning to train the next generation of the network based on games played using the previous one against itself (“self-play”) so without any external influence. The initial network is trained using random games so there is no human input in the process. The next network improvement comes from using a (small) search tree to improve the neural network’s evaluation of a position and using this outcome, together with the game result, to train the next network. Any principles used during play are discovered this way, but not in a way that can be easily extracted as such. Obviously, the rules of chess are hard-coded in the engine.""

Disease risks They analyzed a lot of polymorphisms in my DNA that have been associated with disease risks.

In my case, I have high risk for three conditions (coronary heart disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease).

The ""average risk"" conditions I have are quite common across populations.  Regarding hereditary diseases, I don't carry any of the about 200 conditions they check for. It doesn't mean it's a 100% I don't carry those gene variants but there is a big chance for that. To check for a specific condition, I'd need a more detailed genetic test.

[/INST] What do you wish you knew before starting your career? I just finished Confessions of a public speaker, a book every speaker should read. I stopped keeping track of how many presentations and keynotes I have given after 500. The book made me think about the one thing that I would have loved to know before even giving a speech. The example I saw back then was that you make a breakthrough (in science, in business, or by publishing a great book, etc.) and then you can ride that wave for many years. I've seen good speakers give the same talk many times. The truth is that in the 21st century it doesn't work. Being a speaker today means that you constantly refresh yourself and the content you present while also making it as spectacular as possible. You have to entertain while keeping your integrity (especially critical for me talking about healthcare). It's a pressing challenge but I've been enjoying this """"ride"""" for long. Along these lines, my new keynote narrative entirely dedicated to artificial intelligence in medicine comes out this September.

[/INST] I hear more and more about Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) while learning about artificial intelligence but I haven't been able to comprehend it properly. Now I just heard a good analogue and I thought I would share it with you.  There is a painter who wants to create better and better fake Picasso paintings and a policeman who wants to spot these fakes with an increasing efficiency. What happens is that the painter keeps getting better at making fakes, while the policeman keeps getting better at detecting those. The two models keep trying to beat each other and after many iterations, the painter creates images indistinguishable from a real Picasso. This was the goal of the whole GAN. It's crucial in medicine where privacy concerns limit the amount of available data because GANs can fill in the missing data, making it possible to produce entirely fabricated patient datasets that are just as useful for training AI as the real thing. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #chess   #deeplearning   #machinelearning   #TMFchessjourney

If a physician listens to your heart sounds with a stethoscope and there was something wrong with the device and it misled the diagnosis, who is to blame? The manufacturer of the stethoscope? Never. The physician is supposed to be using all the available technologies at their disposal and with their expertise and knowledge therefore only they can be blamed, the final decision is their responsibility.  The same applies to the use of A.I. It is a (regulated, supervised and assessed) tool in the physician's hand and thus only contributes to the decisions, not making them.

It basically says that high-level reasoning requires much less computation than low-level sensorimotor skills. In short, it's easier to write a program to be the CEO of a major company than to be a coal miner.  As Hans Moravec writes, ""it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility"". Regarding the A.I. era of medicine, it might mean that it makes more sense to teach an algorithm to get better at certain skills important for us working in healthcare than expect programmers to write a code that can do it right away. Meaning we have to be very patient with algorithm when they come to medicine. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #chess   #deeplearning   #machinelearning   #TMFchessjourney

[/INST] Very promising papers come out every day about machine and deep learning algorithms used for medical and healthcare purposes and this field is just blowing up. I received questions from physician colleagues who are not A.I. experts about how they should evaluate these papers. I thought I would share a few things I do myself. - It matters where the paper is published. It's not scientific elitism but it matters if a new algorithm gets presented in Nature Medicine or in a third level journal. - Look for the Methods section where they describe where they got the data. No algorithm can be trained without a good amount of quality data. Some groups just use a good dataset and do tricks on it to make it bigger (e.g. invert images to double the database size). That's not the same as getting a huge amount of annotated data. - Look for the clinical collaboration they had. If an algorithm works well on a pre-selected dataset, that sounds fine. But when it works on clinical datasets too, that is the one we are looking for. When I saw @ DeepMind  collaborating closely with the NHS, I knew that was the right direction.

This is where artificial or augmented intelligence can jump in.  A Chinese company, RXThinking, is training medical algorithms to become super-diagnostician that can be dispatched to all corners of China. Instead of replacing physicians with algorithms, RXThinking's A.I.-based diagnosis app empowers them because it acts like a navigation app for the diagnostic process, drawing on all available knowledge to recommend the best route but still letting the physicians control the decision-making process.

[/INST] The question about A.I. is never technology vs humans. GM Garry Kasparov introduced the concept of advanced chess, also known as cyborg or centaur chess. He wanted to bring together human and computer skills to achieve the following results: - increasing the level of play to heights never before seen in chess; - producing blunder-free games with the qualities and the beauty of both perfect tactical play and highly meaningful strategic plans; - offering the public an overview of the mental processes of strong human chess players and powerful chess computers, and the combination of their forces. The most exciting medical studies that used machine or deep learning did not conclude that algorithms are better than physicians at doing a specific task but those that showed how the combination of computational and human cognition leads to the best results.

Brennan Spiegel, MD, MSHS  and the VR clinical research team at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center have been doing a tremendous job assessing the health benefits of virtual reality. They have been experimenting with the technology for several years and found a significant drop in pain scores in case of VR therapies. What strikes me in their story is that the immersive,  multi-sensory environments had a more significant impact on patients when medical professionals participated in the therapy as a guide, introducing the technology gradually and coaching the patient along the session. VR is an area of endless possibilities, but it can demonstrate it’s real effect when it’s combined with the human touch, medical professionals taking up the role of guiding their patients through digital health technologies. #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #fromchancetochoice   #speaker   #keynote   #speakerlife

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:As a chess player approaching 1500 ELO, I reflect on the parallels between mastering the game and the complex challenges of medicine, ultimately arguing that incorporating artificial narrow intelligence into daily medical practice is crucial for optimizing therapy and monitoring. [/INST] So I've been progresing in chess studying openings and exercising 2-3 hours every day. I'm around 1400 ELO on  chess.com  (an increase of 600 points since November). I learn so much about how A.I. will be used in medicine on the way. Rudolf Spielmann said that in chess, """"Play the opening like a book, the middle game like a magician, and the endgame like a machine.” There is a huge overlap with how we practice medicine.  The opening is obtaining data and information about patients. It should be done like reading a book. Seamless and by the rules. The middle game is the hard part: making a diagnosis. It is even currently being done like magicians do their job. A lot of people don't understand it but it's fascinating, hard and creative.  The endgame is the therapy and monitoring part which should work like a machine: automated following guidelines. This is only possible by implementing artificial narrow intelligence into the daily work of medical professionals. This is why it's so important to understand the basics of A.I. On the photo, I discuss an opening issue with a potential GM. ☺ #themedicalfuturist   #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #technology   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #chess   #deeplearning   #machinelearning   #TMFchessjourney

It means you describe rules and then let the algorithm get outputs. Then you retrospectively tell the algorithm which output was fine and it creates its own rules for reaching those outputs. Do you know what it means?  It means it's not bound the cognitive limitation of people. Physicians have been accusing me that I want to take away their ""art of practicing medicine"". I now go further than that. The era of medicine being an art will just begin when reinforcement learning tackles medical tasks.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Last November, I started working with IM Ármin Juhász to understand how humans can excel at a task like chess with the help of computers, with the ultimate goal of applying this knowledge to medicine and healthcare. [/INST] Last November, I decided to start working with a chess trainer because chess is the perfect example for how humans use computers to excel at a task. My theory was that learning to play chess hours every day will help understand better the issues around how humans can work with computers in medicine and healthcare. I'm extremely lucky to have the chance to learn from IM Ármin Juhász who is not only the world's second youngest highest ranked FIDE trainer at the age of 20 with an ELO of around 2400 but also an exceptional teacher who teaches like someone who has been doing this for decades. Besides these, he has a wicked chess humor (so they say...). I dedicate the following weeks to raising issues about the role of artificial intelligence in medicine, healthcare and pharma. As I dive deeper and deeper into these topics, I'll keep on sharing all the experiences, details and questions that arise.  I hope you will follow me on my journey as artificial intelligence is the biggest threat as well as the biggest opportunity for humanity's progress, especially in healthcare. Digital health technologies will only make patients the point-of-care with proper, accurate and safe A.I. #digitalhealth   #future   #healthcare   #medicine   #AI   #artificialintelligence   #chess   #TMFchessjourney

A lot of people and even large organizations don't. That's why I introduced the Gary-rule in it. Here it is. If a technological issue comes up in a healthcare setting such as the antivirus software becomes outdated or the electronic medical record system stopped working, and we have to call Gary, the IT guy, as he is alone capable of solving it whatever methods he uses, it’s an IT issue. If Gary is not enough to address the problem because more stakeholders of healthcare must get involved, (e.g., letting patients bring the data of their trackers into the medical practice and merge that with electronic medical records, or allowing physicians to do remote consultations on a regular basis), it’s digital health.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What are the benefits of using digital technologies like social media and healthcare stickers to improve patient experiences and consultations in healthcare settings? [/INST] Dr. Zsuzsanna Varga, a primary care physician in Budapest, put the Ask Me About Digital sticker on her door.  She told me: “a young girl came in the other day, who saw the badge earlier that week, so she was brave enough to come in and show me the pictures she took with her phone on her urticaria that only comes in the morning. The patient also told me about how she googled her symptoms but couldn’t find any reasonable explanation. She was happy about the badge because she has mixed experiences of googling and interpreting it to healthcare practitioners. I think it’s a great possibility to get closer to younger generations because she felt safe and understood, so she won’t be hesitating next time she has any problem”.

Now it's just pure attention.  What I learnt here is not that being an influencer with millions of followers without any ""traditional"" content or quality is bad. What I learnt that for all of us who discuss health, technology and science online, we need to learn how to get quality attention, not just how to provide quality content.  If you have a favorite online influencer in any topic you like to follow, please share which one and why.

[/INST] We need a new Hippocratic Oath that meets the expectations of the 21st century. The Hippocratic Oath is the most famous text in Western medicine and constitutes the ethical basis of the medical profession. For centuries, it has provided an overview of the principles of this noble mission and doctors’ professional behavior. At the dawn of a new era in medicine, it is high time to rewrite the Oath so that it would reflect the state of technological development, changes in social structures and in general, the requirements of the 21st century.  So far, no leader of a medical school has taken up the challenge of upgrading their oath to the new one.

[/INST] I ordered steak. The menu item blinked in red twice in my digital lens but I didn’t care. I was very hungry and I love meat. Since it became possible to merge our genomic data with health records in the cloud synchronized with each and every digital device, choosing food has turned into a stressful activity. They wanted to tell me what and when to eat and it has made me crazy. They knew better what me and especially my body needed. My grandfather told me that back in the day nobody knew what the hell you were eating. You just went to a restaurant, ordered and finished your meal. Simple as that. I know they died from a lot of diseases without any foreseeable signs but still. That freedom of choice is special. I don’t even understand why we bother to eat at all today. Just choose whatever is tailored to me and bring it in a powder or something. It’s not worth the effort when it’s so expensive to eat less healthy foods or choose what is out of my metabolic bounds. Sometimes I wish I were in the old ages with infections, sudden deaths, and short lifespans. But man, going out to eat whatever you want must have been a hell of an experience.

It made no sense to me, a child who was growing up in rural, predominantly white Minnesota but I knew what Aaron had done was a very big deal, by my grandfather's reaction. Bigger than being the best baseball player alive. I am grateful to Henry Louis Aaron for combating racism and changing hearts and minds with his talent and grateful to my grandfather for having a conversation with me that too many  parents or grandparents would likely avoid having with a four year old.  #perseverance   #champion

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:As an employer, I'm tired of being told that providing support for working caregivers is too costly, so I'm calling on insurance companies, employers, and government agencies to take action - it's time to create a comprehensive support system for working caregivers, who often face significant challenges in balancing work and caregiving responsibilities, and can have a significant impact on employee engagement and productivity, with up to 60% of staff feeling isolated and unsupported in this role. [/INST] Attention employers and benefits managers! I am a caregiver and just spent the past 2 hours on the telephone with Medicare and a supplemental insurance company (starts with an M ends with a A) because said insurance company didn't disenroll my mother when she moved to another state 4 months ago. I called to let them know of the move when it occurred as well as notifying Medicare and SSA. Now her doctor is unable to see her unless she pays out of her own pocket because this supplemental plan is an obstacle and preventing her from getting the new plan in her new state. Her medication is necessary to prevent her from having additional strokes. I can't put this off or deal with it tomorrow. Employers, this is an example of what up to 60% of your workforce is dealing with that is impacting engagement and productivity. This is why you need to offer solutions to support working caregivers now. Covid 19 has made caregiving at least 50% more challenging. Contact me, I can quickly help you implement a plan to support working caregivers.  #employeebenefits   #workingcaregivers

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Envisioning and replicating community-run, regional healthcare models inspired by the Hospices De Beaune in France, exploring the potential for entrepreneurial and grassroots solutions to provide compassionate care to all, regardless of socioeconomic status, in the United States. [/INST] It was a pleasure visiting the Hospices De Beaune in the Burgundy region of France today.  The story of Chancellor Nicolas Rolin who in 1443 built a beautiful place to care for the poor and sick at no charge really struck me.  He didn't cut corners and great thought went into creating a beautiful, compassionate environment for healing.  Wealthier patients did pay a small fee and had more private accommodations. Many also freely donated. The church and King Louis also provided funds and nuns cared for the sick. Those funds insured that everyone received care. Nuns even made fresh bread every morning to give to the townspeople who were suffering after the hundred year war. Wine from grapes in the vineyard were sold to fund the hospital.  To this day it is a symbol of great pride and compassion in the region.   Care and compassion to those who are suffering in a community makes the entire community stronger and more peaceful. People who show up and support one another thrive.  What would happen if in America there were smaller, regional models of care like this? Could communities create and find ways to fund care for everyone rich or poor?  Would someone be willing to manage it without receiving a seven figure salary?   #entrepeneurship   #healthcare   #business   #community

As few expect new policy actions, the Fed's communication challenge (and, therefore, the scope for market reaction) is less in the statement and more in the press conference ... particularly when it comes to (i) the execution details of the previously-announced measures, and (ii) other measures should they be needed. As regards the GDP number, and even though the economic shut down started in mid March, consensus expectation is for a 4% contraction. Would be the first negative quarter in six years, would get close to the -4.4% of Q-1 2009, though not the -8.4% of the last quarter of 2008. Sadly, the contraction of the first quarter of this year will, in retrospect, prove to be very small relative to the one occurring this quarter. #markets   #economy

The new team of 15 McKinsey partners includes five women whereas previously it had one.  It is also less heavily skewed towards partners from the Western Hemisphere, and includes the heads of six regions: Europe, Latin America, China, Asia ex-China, North America, and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

The best present you can give them this year isn't a gift card ... or your pity. Give them the gift of your time (and connections) instead. 1. Acknowledge how hard their situation is. Sugar coating doesn't help; your sympathy will. Try not to be afraid of their sorrow or anger, and by all means don't treat their unemployment as if it's contagious. 2. Offer to get together after the holidays. Treat them to a lunch or cup of coffee; when you're worried about money, this goes a long way. And don't talk exclusively about their job search. Have a real, human conversation. Make them laugh, if possible. 3. Ask them specifically what they're looking for and identify quality contacts in your network for introductions. Stay on the lookout for job openings, as well as new contacts who might offer the next step in the process. 4. Stay in touch. There's nothing lonelier than looking for a job.   5. Ask: ""How can I help?"" and then deliver. Ghosting is an exceptionally hurtful thing to do to a job seeker.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What does genuine gratitude mean in a professional context and how can understanding its nuances foster a more positive and empowered work environment? [/INST] What does it actually mean to be grateful, the most overused (and possibly least understood) word of the holiday season? *Gratitude isn’t about mouthing platitudes; it’s about a heightened awareness of what we experience, down to a comfortable office chair or a warm sip of coffee.  When we stop taking things for granted, we immediately widen our capacity for patience and creativity.  And yet, being grateful is not the same as being passive. We can be thankful for what we have while still advocating for more justice and equality in the workplace. *Telling people (such as your employees or colleagues) to be ""thankful for what they have"" produces the exact opposite effect.  *It’s impossible to experience gratitude when we believe we’re solely responsible for where we are in our careers. Gratitude and entitlement are always mutually exclusive.  What have you learned about gratitude in the workplace?

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:How can acknowledging and expressing gratitude instead of apology improve relationships in the workplace and everyday interactions? [/INST] When do you say ""I'm sorry?"" For many of us, ""I'm sorry"" is our meaningless default response when we've inconvenienced a colleague. The better response is to recognize what they did for us, and say  ""Thank you"" instead.  Try ""Thanks for your flexibility"" instead of ""I'm sorry I'm late because (insert lame excuse here)."" Try ""Thank you for your patience"" instead of ""I'm sorry I missed that deadline (more flimsy excuses here)."" A good followup is stating how you'll make sure that specific behavior doesn't happen again. This change in vocabulary does something powerful: it shifts the focus away from you and toward the person who had to accommodate you. Of course, if a situation warrants a genuine apology, saying ""I'm sorry"" is only the first step toward reconciliation, not the end point.

Sometimes ""I'm sorry"" is a default response in a situation where we really need to say ""thank you"" instead. That's how we can recognize the inconvenience we've caused and express our gratitude.  Try: ""Thank you for your patience"" instead of ""I'm sorry I'm late because (insert flimsy excuse here)."" Try: ""Thanks for your flexibility"" instead of ""I'm sorry I missed that deadline."" This small change in vocabulary shifts the focus from us (and our often irrelevant excuses) to the people we have impacted with our behavior. And when a genuine apology is needed, the words ""I'm sorry"" are the starting point, not the end, to making retribution.

[/INST] How do you define success? Salary? Job title? That mythical corner office/cube?  I was at a conference recently where a speaker (whose name escapes me, unfortunately) had a different definition. Success, she said, is the ability to influence the culture of your workplace. You don't need a corner office, a senior management position or a hefty bi-weekly paycheck to do that. For me, I reach for success by practicing the following:  *Transparency in process and outcomes *Clear communication (especially with assignments and deadlines) *Kindness (without being a pushover) *Accountability *Openness to feedback (especially when I don't like what I'm hearing) *Gratitude How about you?

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What are the five essential elements needed for successful employee engagement, productivity, and retention at work, and why do they outweigh superficial office perks and benefits? [/INST] Five things we all need to succeed at work (and not one is a Foosball table, beer-cart Fridays or an open office environment): 1. The tools to get the job done 2. Clear expectations and goals 3. Regular constructive feedback (as in weekly or even daily; not once a year) 4. A sense of purpose and meaning (with the knowledge of how the work impacts company goals) 5. A well-trained manager who has hands-on experience in the work her team does #5 is essential to deliver #1 through #4. To maximize retention and productivity, this is where companies need to invest resources.  Nice office spaces and perks are fine, but they are a poor substitute for actually investing in each employee's success.

(Now is NOT the time to offload those dreadful platitudes about ""Follow your passion!"" and ""Do what you love!"" Resist, I beg of you.) *Your job leads. (Our chances of getting a job improve dramatically when we know someone on the inside. Keep your eyes open for opportunities for the new grads you know.) *Your perspective.

What if we wrote that dreaded list as a victory lap, thinking about what we’d celebrate getting done?  What would you feel really good about accomplishing by the end of the day? What would make your boss happy? What task has been hanging over your head like a baby grand piano?

When the scandal broke about Cambridge Analytica and the massive misuse of personal information on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg explained to the New York Times that he needed time to figure out what to say.   Bunk. These are the points Facebook could have addressed within 30 minutes of the news: 1. We are sorry for the harm we caused our followers. 2. We are figuring out how we can make amends. 3. We are working on a plan to make sure this never happens again. 3. We will have an update for you on (date). Rinse and repeat every time more information is available to be released to the public and to shareholders. Even if you're not Facebook, all companies need a template for a crisis communications statement. That allows for quick messages to be pushed out in an hour or less.  Four days is an eternity in the age of social media. And when a company fails to fill the void following a crisis of this scale, we will fill it for them. And in this case, it's a rallying cry to #deleteFacebook.

(“What do you mean we can’t do this? I’ll show you!”)  And yet, lately I am trying to think of “No” as  a tool for making sure I can say “Yes” to the commitments I’ve already made.  ""No"" can also be a source of useful information. When a client or a colleague says ""No,"" that tells me the timing for the idea may be wrong or perhaps I haven't sold it well enough. Sometimes ""No"" means ""Not now"" rather than ""Never."" Sometimes ""No"" helps us pause and rethink our priorities.  You could say I'm trying to say ""Yes"" to occasionally saying ""No.""

I had no idea who the people named were or why they mattered to the winner. (I understand they were trying to check a lot of professional boxes, but without context it's hard to care.) Good speakers keep their audience in mind and have a clear goal: get more eyes on your product, in this case a movie. Will motivate viewers to pay for it, either in theaters or on a device? *What was the inspiration for the work you did?  *What made it worth this recognition?  *How did it change your life?  *How might it change the life of someone in the audience?

But many of the best mentors I've had were people who were younger than me and  had fewer years in the work force.  Sometimes they offered me a sense of passion when I was feeling jaded. Or insights into an audience or technology that I lacked. Quite often they were exceptionally good thinkers, who were willing to wrestle a problem to the ground and explore out-of-the-box solutions. The right question to ask when looking for a mentor is ""What do I need right now to move myself forward professionally?"" The answer is never dictated by age or experience. Wisdom is always bigger than the human limitations we put on it.

[/INST] Two of my favorite words -- ""Yes and"" -- are indispensable during negotiations or tense conversations. ""No but"" often becomes our default phrase when the stakes are high. We're afraid to use ""yes"" in these situations because we mistakenly think it's synonymous with agreement.  ""Yes"" means: ""I hear you. I understand what you're saying.""  ""And"" means: ""Now I will share my take on the situation."" Replacing ""No but"" with ""Yes and"" isn't a magic wand. But this simple substitution improves the chances of breaking up a conversational logjam. When we feel acknowledged, we're less defensive and more open to listening to other points of view. At the very least, the door to moving forward remains ajar instead of closed.

We'd rather have chats about new sofas and new wallpaper, than face the idea we've got existential problems that need deep rethinking. Department stores simply do not need to exist, banks need to accept it's customer experience, not vaults that matter. Car companies need to accept car dealerships are increasingly unhelpful. TV companies need to rethink the rules and opportunities of entertainment.  People think of digital transformation as the refurbishment business. People think transformation is like ""home decor"" shows where you know a month after the camera crew leaves the hacks, the workarounds, the sprayed on silver, have worn off and reality hits you. It was exciting, it looked better, people seemed happy but the issues remain.  Digital transformation needs to move from refurbishment to the construction industry. A way to build the construction you should have, in the place you should have, and to then plan the migration between the two.   It's not cheap, it's not fast, it's not easy, but for some companies it's essential Often a startups only advantage, is that it starts from nothing

From announcing “investing” $1.5bn in Bitcoin to promising tunnels it can’t build, to cars it can’t possibly make, reality never seems to catch up with intentions that suit journalists around the world as dramatic headlines garner clicks.

Kodak did a double pivot, from Photography to a failed CryptoCoin to failed Vaccine maker and benefits all the way. C3 Energy changes name to C3 IOT to C3.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:The democratization of advertising has reordered the industry's landscape, fundamentally changing how brands acquire and advertise with others. [/INST] The big story of Advertising since 2010 isn't that things went online, it's that Advertising became democratized.  In 2005 -  you needed a media buyer, a media planner, a creative shop and there were perhaps 100,000 advertisers, spending an average of $1m. The more you spent, the better the rates. In 2020- there are perhaps 12 million advertisers, spending an average of $40,000.  To advertise you need a credit card and the prices are the same for everyone. The advertising ecosystem still exists because the top 100,000 spenders still behave like the used to, and the 12,900,000 new Advertisers were incremental. The big questions will be: What happens when the 5,000th biggest advertiser acquires a brand that's tripled in size in a year, spent the same on media as them, and employs 1/50th of the people in Marketing. What happens a $100m advertiser's CFO hears at a conference that a $5bn brand has no agencies.  The best question remains ""what would your company look like if you set it up today"" & the scary question is you'd create nothing like any large agency.  You'd have 100 times fewer but better people, generalists and specialists, no more than 5 offices in the world, you'd bring commerce and content and advertising and customer experience together.  It would be easy.

In the classic sensed and defined use of the world ""Disruption"" doesn't explain..... -Tesla - iPhone -Uber -Airbnb -Venmo -Tinder - DJI Drones - Sonos Amazon, Dyson, WeWork,Juul, Instacart, Magic Leap, RobinHood, Oyo, Roku, Klarna, Lemonade, IKEA, Monzo, Bird, Peloton, Oscar, SmileDirect,  and basically every single interesting company that we consider disruptive. Neither does technology explain them. They are only and entirely around understanding that a changing world changes the physics of business and the patterns of consumer behavior and these are the companies with people either optimistic, audacious, imaginative or naive enough to do that.

We’ve kept kids away from each other, told people to not to go outside, and to distrust and be distant from each other.

We closed gyms and the world with zero thought for the moderation they provide.  We’ve removed our ability to smile at strangers, communicate expressively or embrace each other.    And all with seemingly zero regard for what this may to us, our kids, the vulnerable, the different.   If mental health had physical symptoms, I wonder how different things would be.

[/INST] “ 2021 will see consumers want and then increasingly demand that the brands they buy stand for something bigger than what they sell, that they take a stand on social issues and use purpose to good for the planet” I keep seeing lines like this in trends decks right now.   Of course it would be great if people behaved this way. It would be marvelous if people aspired to this. But there is very little evidence of it.   We can frame the data to make that point, we can find cases studies, but it doesn’t seem very true.  Not least because nobody has the time to audit the brands they buy.  Instead like the vast majority of future trend / consulting documents it’s based on surveys. Surveys that people answer based on what looks like the “correct” answer. Surveys designed to elicit helpful findings.  Do some qual, talk to your customers, understand them deeply, understand their needs in depth & above all else get out of the mass delusion of the Marketing bubble. The reality is that Amazon and Facebook couldn't really be more damaging as entities. DoorDash treats workers terribly. Uber isn't a saint. But we're at home, and we're hungry and we press a button and we let principles evaporate because,  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . We may not like it, I don't, but that doesn't make it less true.

In fact so much data that we're not able to comprehend what we've done, so we think of it as ""gut"" Many would say we drive using our ""gut"", we see the body language of a kid & think they may jump out after a ball. We're processing enormous amounts of pure objective data in ways we discount as ""feeling"". Sportspeople are also good examples.  When we make decisions with data, we're either picking data we found easily because someone wanted to persuade us, or we're using our own bias based on what we wanted to think and find or on who we decided to ask or listen to.   When we make decisions with data, we're processing tiny amounts of messy data in ways we overvalue as ""data driven decisions"" I really wish we could come to love and respect and develop the innate human qualities we all have in spades, be more aware of the problems of bias involved in this & work against that and to stop our unwavering respect and love of data.

Something that if a single person anywhere on the project had talked to a single person in Art for 5 mins would have been clear.  Digital art is about art that moves,or generative Art that can pull in data to change based on context. It’s incredibly exciting Being a pain, I spent many hours emailing people in Samsung, in marketing, in NPD, in PR and explained that it would be super easy to do a software update that allows this, it would cost nothing & would change the entire meaning and use of the product.

I love electronics, my first job was as a salesperson in the UK version of Best Buy, I'm far more interested than most people. I've led and written tours at CES for the last 5 years. I started doing research only on 2020 model OLED screens from LG, it turns out you get to pick between the:  CX Series GX Series BX Series C9 Series WX Series ZX Series Z9 Series E9 Series W9 Series RX Series - Who on earth would decide to sell such a massive variety of TV's within the small expensive NICHE that is OLED screen? - Why would you create such bizarre illogical names, with no obvious ranging in mind?  -Why would you host them all on your owned website and offer no attempt to explain the differences between them.

Would it be so strange to  1) Use customer insights to inform product design, and use to offer clear differentiation in a meaningful way. 2) Offer clear ranging, how about the A Series, B Series, X Series. 3) Have a website that explains the features.

[/INST] Always seems like it's the middle that's hard. You can become a mass car maker if you can commit to shifting 100,000+ cars per year, or you can be a niche player making 200 cars by hand, but how do you make 15,000 cars?  You can be a DTC brand dropshipping 5000 units per year as a hobby and buying ads on Facebook, or be massive, buy space in retailers, invest in brand advertising and churn out millions of products. But being in the middle is hard.  You can be a thrusting start up breaking little laws, or skirting regulations knowing if you probably won't get noticed, and if you do you won't destroy a brand with heritage and value. Or you can be a huge companies with the best lawyers around, but being medium sized is hard.  It's not incredibly hard to be small, it's not hard to stay big, but it's hard for small to scale to big, and it's hard for big to act or do small.  A lot of startup life is burning rocket fuel (cash) to escape the earth's gravitational pull ( unit economics). A lot of brands still haven't made it to orbit, but we celebrate their altitude, even though it means a crash to earth would be even more devastating.

It's far easier to make far far more money by using more people as billable team, than it is to be bold and say ""we just need a tiny number of brilliant people with time to think"".

Try to bill $15k a month for 3 brilliant people for a few hours here and there, to develop amazing ideas, offer fleeting moments of brilliance, to share wisdom and insights built over 40 years, to transform the quality of work done and it's considered wildly extravagant. This is less about the age old ""how do we bill for our time"" question and more a ""We are producing terrible work because we are creating expensive constructs, that many waste their lives working for and this is a shameful loss to everyone, because we dare not take the risk of appearing excessive ""  Ultra long haul jetliners burn far more fuel to carry their own fuel, than the people they transport.

US Healthcare is an incredible mess, but you can have thin horizontal layers that try to help, but just act as bandaids.

Education is the same, we've got snazzy new tablets, to teach a curriculum based on the values and needs of Napoleonic armies. We teach answers, not how to think.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:Describe how the perception of technology in large corporations has shifted from being a cost center and administrative function to a vital part of innovative culture and business strategy. [/INST] One of the reasons many large companies mess up is how they think of Technology. For the first 40 years of its existence,  ""IT"" was basically a support function. It was an administrative function, rather like stationery procurement, or finding office cleaners, or  photocopier maintenance. It was a cost center, the role was to spend the least money with them and for it not to be noticed. IT were always the people in the darkest room, the cramped office.  They'd try to persuade Leadership teams to upgrade to Windows XP, or the benefit of a new server or to invest in new laptops and nobody ever cared to listen. And now the world is IT.  Some companies now have CTO's to  evangelise the power of tech at the highest levels, to orchestrate culture around it, but most have no senior representation of Tech in any forum. New technology is a lever to what we can do, it aids our imagination, multiplies our potential, saves us time. New tech is a vital part of understanding modern behaviors and changing business models.  And yet it's remarkable how many companies still think of it as something to outsource, to reduce, to save on.

[/INST] A lot of the most important, challenging & unresolved problems in the modern era are extremely complex. It's easy to appear to solve them quickly in a superficial fast way. But to really solve them we need to address them properly, to understand the fundamentals on which they have formed, often the errors of human circuitry and the slow aggregation of a legacy of awful decisions.  We are in a weird modern era where the rigorous questions required to reveal the foundations more unwelcome than ever. Where the scrutiny and soul searching needed to provide clarity are deemed hostile. When debate involves questions, probing and testing viewpoints that are these days career-ending ( both if taken out of context, and increasingly in context)  despite their utterly noble intentions.   We need a lot more scrutiny, we need powerful, honest critical thinking. We need debate, nuance, to be comfortable operating near points of huge contention. We need sophisticated fact-based discussion with near impunity. Not because it's a sign of an advanced liberal tolerant world with freedom of speech, but because it's how we REALLY understand and then start to address & then solve the big issues today.   We are doing ourselves a huge disservice. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

[/INST] Boeing had issues with the 737Max because it was too expensive and would take too long to design the entire airframe from scratch again.   It would mean a whole new plane, new certification, new training for pilots. They figured out that the much larger engines , which would get the improvements they needed in efficiency ( after being slow to respond to airbus) could just about work on the same airframe.   They’d place them further forward and higher up, and while the plane wouldn’t be able to fly or glide naturally, they’d write some software to keep it in the air.   There is a big difference with a plane that is easier to fly, that is aided by software and one that can’t fly unless software is constantly working to keep the thing airborne.  There are few short cuts when it comes to profound transformation.  Sticking new things on rarely works anywhere except shareholder presentations and for a short period of time.

It dawned on us that by calling the project "" travel card"" , we've already decided the nature of the solution.  Likely solutions would be  a ""paper"" card and vending machines or NFC cards and barriers or most ambitiously ""apps"" with virtual cards"" It's not just that it limited the form factor, it's that it limited the entire philosophy to the problem. Maybe the future of public transit ticketing should be based around facial scanning, or retrospectively being charged based on your phones movement depending on time of day, or it being free of charge?  We often make TINY unconscious decisions in how we frame a problem that have HUGE implications on how it's solved. It could be the people we ask to the meeting, the budget we allocate, the timeline, and in this case the name. Budget is especially interesting, the larger a budget is, the more expensive, complex and physical the solution has to be in order for people to not feel vulnerable. Imagine the courage to tell people we don't need a $150bn high speed train, we need to encourage people to work from home .

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:The transformation of building businesses from construction-focused to software-as-a-service model led to an era of accelerated innovation, reduced risk, and increased emphasis on interfaces and interoperability over construction, but also creates new challenges for expertise, assets, and adaptability. [/INST] Building a modern business is no longer ""building"", it's assembly.  ""Making"" a mobile phone in 2005 meant creating your own hardware and making your own software, now it's using licensing software and assembling components. ""Car Makers"" in 2010 put 30,000 components together, 1,000 of which moved. Car makers today can use a ""Skateboard"" and build far more simply and quickly, modern car's can be developed in a year, one of the fastest cars in the world is made by Rimac with a handful of staff and little experience. Modern companies don't need to own mainframes, or construct anything, they simply ""rent"" prefabricated software which they license and they arrange techstacks around their needs. It becomes more about interfaces and interoperability than constructions. It's more proof that it's now faster, easier and cheaper and with less risk to build than ever, and likely harder, more culturally complex & slower to change.   Increasingly your expertise moves from being less unhelpful to being a barrier to change. Your assets become anchors not foundations.    Your ability to learn more important than your ability to know. https://lnkd.in/dKe8ejc

I mean it shouldn't be new news or shocking, but I firmly think a lot of people misunderstand that the lines and containers of the past are irrelevant now. Almost all competition is asymmetric. What matters now is who used to challenge you, but who can move into your space and what cards do they hold? Is it easier for someone with trust, an audience, technology or expertise or assets to win?   We've long assumed tech companies played the killer cards, but that's not always the case. They often just have deeper pockets to lose and last longer than others.   But rethinking your competitors and your gameplan and more imaginatively has never been more vital

[/INST] It's strange that we never really design any parts of our lives. Like we basically live on autopilot for 18-30 years, then look at all the things we've somehow accumulated, stuff, responsibilities, relationships and then try to move it around a bit, add a bit of fun between them.  And at that point so many large things have been fixed, our ability to actually craft out the life we wanted is impossible and we'd never dared ask before what was important to us.  Many assume we want to live in a house, that it should have a garden, that we should own it. Many assume we should have a single job, that's full time, that slowly pays more, that we do till the age of 60+, Many assume they want kids.  And before we know it we've mortgages, commutes, fixed costs, fixed parameters.  It's then pretty hard to alter things.  Quite a lot of people plan their homes interiors, a lot of people plan their businesses, a lot of people plan holidays or gardens, but seems like very few people plan or design their lives. We just shuffle around things we assumed awe wanted an aggregated, often against ideas and societal expectations that come from an era of scarcity and vulnerability and bodies that wore out and education being  scarce etc.  Just an observation, it's not like I've done it.

[/INST] Each new screen in our lives has become smaller, more personal and we’ve sat closer to it.  From Movie theaters (1905)  to TV’s to Laptops and now Smartphones( 2006) , we now consume something specifically and only for us. Unlike movies or TV, what we watch isn’t based on us selecting, but pushed to us based on decisions we’ve made in the past. Everyone watched the same movie at a showing, but each and every social feed is unique. As we get closer to screens our eyes fix upon pixels and block out the real world. Feeds update in real-time, everything seems dominant and immediate. We stop observing, we lose perspective both on the world around us, and the notion of time, and history. As lockdowns again sweep the world, our chance to see the real world, to get perspective, to share feelings with others, to discuss to learn, not get “likes” to have chats “off the record”, to be wrong, is removed again. The world becomes ever more fervent, radical, divided, emotional, and this maybe offers some explanation. All our bridges, all of our context, we’re removed.

There is a LOT of great chat now about ""rethinking work"" and new ways to brainstorm remotely or explore ideas collaboratively.  I can help but think it's easier than that. 1) Companies need to use meetings the right way. Is it to make decisions, to get buy in, to sell or to create a feeling of togetherness.  Choose the attendees, format, preparation and time for it based around that. 2) Do the things that matter most, say no to 80% of things. Don't prioritize easy, fast, cheap, prioritize the things that really matter. Honestly, most of what everyone does is just busy work because nobody had the guts to say ""no"" 3) Make things simple. For those not launching rockets, what we do is pretty simple. We don't need that much time, that many points of view. We've been tricked into thinking things are ever more complex and have changed a lot, they haven't.

Disruption theory always focussed on how emerging technology allowed new threats to appear and assumed it was ""tech-driven"".  It was really how a mindset that resisted the imagination to think in different ways. It was the psychology of loss aversion meaning changing felt like failure. It was that expertise was invested in the ways from the past. A business case for change is impossible until too late.  Disruption is about challenging assumed constraints. It could be Dick Fosbury leaping higher with the Fosbury Flop, Dyson not being afraid to make vastly more expensive Vaccums,  Tesla rethinking the potential of electric propulsion, Apple realizing it's about how it feels to use a device, not what it can functionally do.

[/INST] Not into sports analogies that much, but there are 2 Sports that I like to use a reference points for business.  This will likely be my worst performing post on Linkedin ever, but I don’t care.  Crap volleyball-While pro’s tend to use a dig first to control the ball, get it high up to buy time, second, the setter places the ball perfectly for the third person to smash it precisely where they want it. In crap beach volleyball, everyone looks terrified, they just whacks it over as soon as they get a chance. The ball is a liability, the solution isn’t to think, to strategize, to understand, it’s to hurriedly pass on. Kabaddi - Here players HOLD’s THEIR BREATH, raid the opponents half, tag as many players as possible, and return to their own half without being captured. When you watch it, players take their time, despite oxygen running low. It's mainly slow movements & then when the moment is right pounce like lightening.  It’s a joy to watch.  Businesses think “the pace of change is so fast, you have to act quickly, constantly, to be exerting energy at all times. But the reality is it’s more about knowing when to be fast, when to be slow and when to commit.

Nobody could ever explain why they were “choosing” to consume stuff, they’d just failed to get up and do something else for long enough.  Most stuff people watch now isn’t selected by them, they tolerate it. It’s a state of both boredom and empty stimulating hypnosis.  It’s this understanding of the fatigued, vapid way that a lot of things are watched and increasingly items are bought, which we need to understand when marketing to people, making shoppable ads and trying to create better stuff for.

[/INST] Quibi.  $1,750,000,000 wasted launching something that any single conversation with any single person under 40 , could have told you within 5 mins was dead on arrival.   The problem these days is too much expertise in the old way of doing things.  It’s way harder to unlearn what you know than to learn new ways of doing things.  Disruption isn’t so much a threat because people don’t see it coming, so much that people have been trained to think their success in the past means something in the future when things change.  We all need to constantly assume we are wrong and seek people to challenge our views.  For one, the entire executive board structure of companies is criminally negligent. Preferring like minded groupthink from the identical privileged but esteemed wise folk of yesteryear.   Wisdom is vital, but so are people with careers ahead of them, unafraid to tell executives they need to rethink what they think they know, be more open minded and listen to their customers

[/INST] The very best ""self-driving car"" is still less capable and safe that some of the worst ever human drivers.  I think about this a lot. If you were to ask someone driving what they were doing, they wouldn't really know. They'd be driving with a mixture of data, feelings, and memory. They'd sense the person crossing the road will take longer because of their demeanor, that a branch could flt on the road because it's windy, but they'd not be able to explain why they feel that way.  Self-driving cars use about 40Gbits per second, they learn from the past, they use incredibly advanced technology that we should be impressed by. We know precisely how they work. But a self-driving car can't tell the difference between a  rock and a packet of crisps on the highway. Some see badly in the sun. They struggle with unmapped roads and with the snow for example.  This feels for me how modern businesses are run. We love processes that seem objective, repeatable, we demand they use vast amounts of data, we don't mind that all their learning comes from that past.

By 1990 we had one computer in every classroom. By 1993, now in Secondary school, we had a special computer room, where all computers were placed together, we had an IT teacher too to ""own"" IT. By 1997 some kids were getting computers at home, by 2005 some kids had laptops, around 2018 is was expected that kids in many schools used their own Laptops or Tablets to be the hub of all the work they do. This best explains how Digital Transformation occurs, we add a little, then we add more, then we have a center that owns transformation, and then it disbands and it's done everywhere. Yet today, kids still learn languages, maths, english literature, History, with a bit of coding added on. If we assume that Schooling is to prepare kids for life, we'd teach them financial literacy, how to build relationships, how to consume media, how to look after their mental health.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What is the true measure of digital transformation excellence, and how can legacy companies overcome the entrenched mindset that holds them back from truly innovating and competing with modern startups? [/INST] Over the last 10 years around $15 Trillion has been spent on Digital Transformation, and yet there are (perhaps) zero case studies of real success. Sure, websites have got prettier, companies have got better EPOS systems, better inventory management, more ""data"", but have we ""Transformed"" or  improved. Almost all ""Transformation"" is simply keeping up with others, maintaining systems or making small incremental improvements. A key part of the issue is that the past holds us back, old systems form the bedrock of most companies, and nobody dare change a foundation that everybody understands ""that"" it works, but nobody understands ""how"" it works.  Senior personnel in IT know that their value comes from knowing how to maintain what they have, from understanding where the skeletons are, from knowing old code, why would they become less valuable building something new?  Legacy companies are basically a world of brick buildings, limited by the physics of bricks, built by bricklayers.  Modern startups are engineers who build from steel and glass. It's a whole new world. Legacy companies won't get there without changing everything they do, the skills they have, and start building new, not seeking to renovate or decorate the old. When they get this, exciting things will happen fast.

Well, here we are. Perhaps we can offer phones to everyone , train people on how to use them, and leapfrog and bypass massive wasteful, slow, inefficient, insecure legacy systems.

[/INST] Online shopping is basically really good when you know specifically what you want.  If you want the Samsung UE32T4307,  or the Beko MGI25332BG - you're two clicks away from a wonderful product at the best price. But the reality is that 99% of stuff we buy isn't like that. Many items don't have product names, many items we need a little  help (and reassurance) in selection, and most items we buy based on discovery and browsing ( Shopping vs Buying )  I maintain that Amazon is the best logistics company the world has ever seen and one of the worst retailers. By stores around the world emulating their faults, we've ended up with awful online retail everywhere. If we were rather unambitious we would make selection easier, we'd craft a more premium experience, we'd make things simpler, we'd have more imaginative ways to filter products.  But the real challenge and opportunity is how do we make buying fun, how do we make it something people would choose to spend time doing. Buying a TV or even a Fridge should be a thrill,  buying some shoes should be something we do from boredom, but instead, the entire process is awful. Amazed how little work I see done to change this, the Nike App is the only Shopping experience I've ever seen which is fun.

[/INST] I spent ages writing a piece about how Marketing will change during/after Covid for a trade mag . About 1500 words in and I realized it would be better as 200 words. 1) Don't try to be precise with tone. If I see one more ad that claims to know how I think, I'll scream. The national mood doesn't exist. It varies from one locality to another, from one day to another, from one household to another. Things are less equal than ever. and more unpredictably so. Trying to latch onto the Zeitgeist is impossible, aim to be a little more vague.  2) Be agile.  Things change fast (see above), the more you can control the creative after launch & the more you can change media plans, the better. Digital media is great for this, but remember digital media is TV, Podcasts, Out of Home, Radio, Magazines (but on the internet), in fact these should be the moments that dynamic placement and real-time ad creation really takeoff. 3) Trust is more vital than ever. We were wrong modern companies don't need to develop relationships with consumers or get rich data, they need to build brands.  Brand building is the only proven way to succeed, it allows you to charge a premium, gain distribution, upsell, cross sell, create new products/ services, defend in a recession etc.

[/INST] The sooner we realize Social Networks are far better as places to listen, rather than broadcast, the better. We seem to think it's a place to argue when it should be a place to debate. Perhaps this shouldn't be a place to show off, but a place to learn.  This is a better place to pose questions, than promote viewpoints. It's a good place not to be supported, but challenged, being wrong means you learn. Almost all posts I do are either questions, or statements like this, not designed to get likes, but designed to spur comments and debate.  On a bad day this gets called contrarianism, or ""Trolling"" Trolls write to offend and get engagement, Contrarians poke to get noticed and build a brand. I'd like to think I'm just here to spark interesting conversations we can learn from and use to open our minds.

[/INST] Always remarkable than the more important and valuable an industry is, the less it's been disrupted, innovated within, and the less customer-focused it is. The most expensive things in our lives, homes, healthcare, pensions, education are all drastically antiquated. Booking a Uber is delightful, but everything about buying a house or a car is awfully messy and old fashioned.  There are wonderful ways to order a pizza, but anything in healthcare is badly design, oblique, messy. Dating is just a swipe, but finding a pension, life insurance, a place to spend a fortune on University education is a mess.

[/INST] One good thing about these strange interim times, is we've stopped talking about the normal silly tech distractions like 3D Printing, Bots, IOT, Drones, or how Voice will change everything. We've moved on from vapid conversations about brand purpose to more sensible questions about how to better serve customers, how to create new products quickly, or how to pivot business models faster than ever.  For years we've gone on about Blockchain but perhaps we should have talked about how to let call center staff work from home.  Perhaps it takes a crisis to move on from distractions to look innovative to the vital (sometimes boring) stuff that really matters.

[/INST] A thought. For years the News has only reported on events that were absolutely extraordinary. Events of massive significance because they were incredibly unusual; plane crashes not car crashes, terrorist attacks, not ongoing civil wars, earthquakes not cancer deaths. We knew that the news wasn't the real world, it was deviations from the real world. We didn't use it to judge the feeling of the world.  Somehow the last few years the news seems more every day, weather events, health events, politicians screwing up, theatres closing, sports, celebrity culture, etc.  I wonder if we now subconsciously think the news is a window onto the world, it's not the remarkable things,  it's the pulse on the world. Is it this which is creating such a pervasive sense of hopelessness and fear and that somehow things are worse than ever.

[/INST] I spent some time in Sweden recently. ALL the people I met all were very happy with their approach. There was more altered behavior in Sweden than the media would make you believe, lots of social distancing, closed Universities, but all done in a reasonable fashion. Even the messaging was done in a spirited way, with large sparkly stickers saying ""YES!"" on train seats where you were able to sit. The behavior changes came about by informing people, and assuming that the vast majority of people will behave sensibly when trusted. At the end of their long summer, there was palpable excitement at the start of a normal life, but also more mask-wearing than what I saw in Denmark.  One thing I'll never understand is why Sweden was one of few nations to follow the long-standing plans Governments had long had in place. They screwed up Care Homes, but the plan to focus only on protecting the vulnerable was the action plan all countries had long had for conditions of this level of contagion and severity.  https://lnkd.in/dzMEkvH

They make decisions based on a fear of missing out, not a passion for what can be done.  -Tech centric, it’s based on the tech du jour, and ignores any aspect of what consumers would love, or what problems we’ve love solved, or what new possibilities there are to create consumer delight VC has killed real innovation, Silicon Valley is the best place to make money from well-executed poor identikit ideas.

This is a situation we are forced into, not one we have chosen as a preference. Yes, we've spent less money, energy & time on commuting, but depression has skyrocketed, anxiety is rife, our mental health has suffered, we feel more alone & we drink more.Long term success is more than survival 2) Did anyone think that working from home was not possible before?  We've had fast broadband/laptops for 13 years, we knew we could work like this, we largely made an informed decision not to. 3) Clearly the future of work is not binary It's working from home, working near home, working near a satellite office and HQ, working from planes, conferences, etc  It should involve more company away days, less time commuting, but it's likely most companies will need large spaces to congregate & employees to rush to the office with short notice sometimes. 4)Many things in life are inefficient, business lunches, flying to shake a hand, that's why they mean a lot.

They've applied & been rejected for several good roles on Linkedin, they've not made any first rounds, and they think they are not good enough. Not by a long shot. Applications on here (for many) are a total waste of time. When we made it free and easy to apply for thousands of jobs, we also ensured that HR would use AI and clumsy tech to filter out all but the most boring risk free candidates. Brilliant people will always fail these. I would suggest the following. 1) Make a simple website with the specific ways you are extraordinary, in simple words. Show proof. 2)Think about roles you are genuinely perfect for. There will not be many. Be honest.  3) Never write to HR, only to a senior executive.  In 100 words get their attention , interest and send on a link to your site. 4) Try to find companies who want to work around your brilliance, not around their limited imagination. It may not work, but it's a lot better than feeling depressed because a HR manager doesn't know how to recruit and it's far more likely to bring about good things.

Even just saying you want to keep in touch because you have interest X or Y in common. I don't need you to work hard on being ""worthy"", I just would like you to think.

Yes, the new normal will mean more remote working, more eCommerce, more direct to consumer brands, more companies using  better technology to work more collaboratively.

There was no Dot Com bubble based on crazy expectations, there was no Sub-Prime scandal. Nothing broke, we just pressed stop.  4) The jobs that tend to be fastest to vanish are typically the fastest to bring back, the work alongside each other. A mall opens, security guards are needed, food court workers are needed, retail workers are needed, car park attendants are needed,  we have systems that fall and come back in there entirety.  5) Pent up demand.  *I've no qualifications in Economics, but since the experts seem wildly in disagreement, it's OK to ponder and listen.

Scientists need to warn of worst case scenarios to ensure their material gets funding / published and to cover their asses.  Scientists who disagree are shunned. Politicians will choose the most negative predictions ( from these outlandish Scientists ) to ensure they have their asses covered & to allow them claim the greatest victory.  Modelers have literally no idea about anything except code, and pull assumptions out of their arses and play with numbers to get the desired outcomes.  And the media will do anything to get clicks.  I wonder if we ever get a chance to see how we got this so wrong, learn from it, and move to more sensible system to help us make smart informed decisions in the future?. Meanwhile we still see bogus science in scientific journals based on methodology that wouldn't pass the smell test in a Primary School project.

This doesn't mean you get to work from home, this means you get to rethink where you live, how you live, and much more.

[/INST] In my lifetime wars have changed. We had the Cold War, the war on Drugs , the war on Terror and can’t help but think the next war will be the war on “the truth” or weaponized information.

Meanwhile what is true isn’t just clear fake news but a mess of propaganda, satire, badly framed statistic, the viral nature of anecdotes.  Covid19 is a clear example of a fog of information war. Nothing seems known, nothing seems clear, everything seems strange. Even info from authorities is contradictory  .

[/INST] I'm not calling for denial, but it's about time the Media turned to optimism.  To some a large extent the World's economy works around confidence in our future, optimism and hope. An owner of retail spaces is more likely to let a retailer miss rental payments if they believe their business will bounce back, A small business owner can likely hang on longer if they can feel a sharp recovery happening soon and have been allowed to fall behind on rent . People are more likely to book a vacation if they feel their job is secure, people's jobs are secure when people spend money. Confidence in the future means stocks rise, bonuses flow, pensions are safeguarded, money is a flow. I'm not asking for propaganda or insensitivity to the loss of life, but every story is being spun in the most negative way possible & we're going to manufacture an era of hopelessness, destroyed futures for the young, all because negative stories earned a few more cents with terrible banner ads.  It's time to see the ample positive data for what it is & get ready for a period of rapid rejuvenation. It is not disrespectful of those who have perished to kindle hope with balanced reporting.

[/INST] Little tip.  It is safe to assume that people really like helping other people.  Generally speaking, those people with the most influence / money / authority to help, have some of the greatest demands on their time & attention.  So when asking for help, try to do three things. 1) Make it as easy as possible to help them. Don't reduce the scope of help needed, but reduce the mental effort required form the other person.  2) Be specific and honest about the help you need.  These are the big two. The 3rd is a bonus. 3) Showing you've been thoughtful and empathetic is wonderful. It's not an ego play, but it shows the person that you are thoughtful, but also shows you've put effort it, that you've not just send the same thing to 100 random people.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What can we learn from the Extinct Rebellion by analyzing the effects of modern society's three core phenomena: extremism, the cultivation of belonging, and the exploitation of attention through outrage-driven mobilization? [/INST] Extinct Rebellion is a good example of 3 common modern day phenomena we should seek to understand.  - Extremism: Information, well presented data and opinion pieces to support pretty much any opinion is readily found on the internet and in huge volumes. One Google search & algorithms create a self reinforcing ""reality"", where any single extreme viewpoint is normalized and supported by an endless recursive loop of more material to entrench a viewpoint further. -Belonging: In an age with declining religion, higher standards of living and fewer social bonds, life feels rather meaningless. There is a strong need to find a tribe to be part of, rituals to provide meaning, a common enemy to bond over.  -Attention hacking: Movements know how to create outrage. The smartphone video is the atomic unit of PR, outrage is the oxygen, they know any events that look shocking on camera will feed a modern press that needs cheap easy video and photo driven stories. Not passing judgement on a movement that I'm sure is based in good intentions. But it's worth understanding more.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What if the pace of technological progress and consumer expectations outstripped the ability of large established companies to adapt and innovate, resulting in a stagnant and increasingly anachronistic status quo? [/INST] I want to coin a new term tomorrow: Digital Constipation. It's the idea that the world isn't changing especially fast, but each and every year what is possible get's more amazing, what consumers expect becomes greater, and yet large legacy companies do absolutely nothing because they are scared or unable to change.  Digital Constipation is the slow build up of detritus, the old process which won't change, the cultural baggage, the scar tissue of fear, bad memories and poor attitudes.  It's this blockage and the tension between what can be done and what is done, which leads to anxiety. It's not the pace of change, it's the ever greater gap, despair and awkwardness for not being contemporary, the jealousy of the smaller companies which get celebrated and the organization rigidity which won't allow adaptation, which creates the pressure on modern large companies. Come be a digital laxative.

How to be calm, how to derive meaning and purpose, how to be resilient, tolerant etc. Seems we expect these things to come from other classes or just by being alive, or to be passed to us innately as instinct. Turns out this course makes it very clear how wrong this is. If you'd ever consider going, I'd recommend it wholeheartedly.

On Ultra long flights, the vast majority of the plane fuel is there as a flying oil tanker, to transport the rest of the fuel, one wonders how often large companies are the same. Existing only to ensure the existence of the company, not actually carrying passengers to their destination. One wonders if you simply focussed on ""doing things brilliantly"" ( making this deliberately vague), that the results, work done and clear momentum wouldn't be so strong, that you'd rarely need to do anything else.

It's not the case that it's inaccurate or sometimes wrong, it's just not remotely true or helpful or has really ever once mapped a close path to reality.

The internet, then the smart phone came into our lives and in many ways and in many places changed the rules of business.

What really makes companies and industries hard to work with is the build up increases each year and is so far unreleased. Meanwhile the companies that emerged continue to become better. It's the tension of what you should have changed that didn't, it's the ever wider gap between what's possible, what's best in class, and what your company does, which is the issue.  The greater the tension that builds, like an earthquake, the greater the force to unleash.  We have a way to go before it hits many industries.

[/INST] Companies often make the mistake of assuming their ""closest competitors"" are those most similar and proximate to their business now. When it's really about who has permission, interest and competency to enter their market in the future. It's taking decades for people to understand this. And it's not really disruption theory, often new competitors don't have lower costs or a cheaper underlying technology, they just serve people better, make a better product, are better orchestrated etc.

Cars today are designed around the cumulation of all frequent use cases, they are inherently COMPROMISED to not be terrible at anything people may want to do semi frequently. If cars are self driving, why would we park them? Why not use them when we are at work. So it's likely we don't own them, but we use them on a ""pay as you go"" basis. We will subscribe to them. If we don't own a car, we can switch from vehicle to vehicle based on what we need. So the design of cars will be OPTIMIZED for specific use cases. Most journeys may be slow urban pods fitting one people, others may be large minibuses for weekend trips.   Imagination is more important to future scenarios, than interpolating trend lines.

They needed people to be cogs in a machine, to be easily replaced, to be specialists, to be opinionless. Companies need to make the most of people, not the same of people. This means flexible working hours, working from home, embracing passions and side projects. It means people with width, and oddness, who can do 8 different things and need to.  We need to accept that literally the only thing that matters is outputs, not process or location, or presenteeism, or even how hard you worked. I'm not saying you need to employ hard people, far from it, I'm saying working with and around the best people will be hard.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What are the key concerns and potential solutions to the impact of emerging technologies like AI on society, according to Andrew Yang, and why do they matter in the context of the 2020 US presidential election? [/INST] Excited to launch my new Interesting People in Interesting Times podcast featuring live talks from the IPIT events in NYC -- a forum for discovery and debate with provocative thinkers, great ideas and bold new thinking.  For our first episode, we spotlight Andrew Yang, tech entrepreneur, author, and founder of Venture for America, who is running for president as a Democrat in 2020.  Andrew talks about the very real and immediate threat of artificial intelligence, how new technologies are erasing millions of jobs before our eyes, and why we need to put humanity first -- or face a future that's going to look like either Mad Max or Star Trek. He also addresses ""the big four"" and what he plans to do about Amazon. For Android people try this.  https://lnkd.in/dnN-tVu

""Linkedin"" but on Blockchain, ""Airbnb"" but with smart contracts, ""Uber"" but with Bitcoin.  It's like our entire world is just sheep. These business models are not perfect, but their faults have nothing to do with what Blockchain may be able to offer.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:As the tech industry continues to thrive, should its glossy conferences and celebrations of innovation be a distraction from the mounting social and environmental crises it is often not addressing? [/INST] I’m kind of slowly starting to think quite radically that we should stop having any press coverage or funding of any technology unless it’s designed in part, in some perhaps oblique way, to bring good to the world and society.  I’m absolutely sick of being in ever more luxurious conference centers at SXSW where we talk about frivolous technology while more and more homeless people gather outside.  In many counties we’re collectively destroying the planet, good jobs, income inquality suffers, healthcare is a mess, we’ve a demographic timebomb. In the USA we’ve got out if control guns, opioid addiction rampant, extremist views. Globally, women are still facing vast problems with any remote from of equality.  We’ve a terrible media and news climate, lies are perpetrated , shitty governments form. Tech needs to start focusing on this or what’s the point. But instead we can order pizza from our shoes and order laundry detergent with our voices and that’s what we talk about ? It’s insane

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What key principles can be distilled from successful tech innovation and company start-ups, namely that grand solutions and bold expectations almost always fail in practice? [/INST] If you want to start a tech based innovation or company, some tips. 1) Work around solving a common problem or pain point so well that people will pay you ( it may not be the consumer)  That's it. Don't assume you change behavior - It's virtually impossible. Don't assume others are like you - If you know tech, you are likely weird. Don't assume you can make money from ads  - You really can't. Don't assume better is better, easier always beats better. Don't assume that things will be different, they probably won't be. Generally speaking it's better to work around, ""we can now fix this"" and not ""this new thing is possible""

It's by far the least secure, most expensive, slowest, most unreliable and most inefficient form of communication with me.  And yet it's how all the most important documents in the world I need to see are sent.

Then they want to use an ICO to raise funds.  Genuine question, why do 99% of Blockchain solutions then use Cryptocurrencies, where does the need to peg solutions to specific arbitrary new currencies?

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for:What are the striking differences in cultural attitudes towards privacy and gun laws between progressive and conservative nations? [/INST] In Sweden there is an app where you can find out where anyone lives and what their direct phone number is. To be removed off the database takes special permission and explanation.   A few more clicks and anyone in the country can find out ANY other person's salary ( they do get told who has asked) It's interesting to compare this openness and transparency with say the German's, who seem to have the greatest fear of losing privacy. But most of all, being here for a few days, while Gun's rightly become the conversation in the USA, it's amazing to see one nation so open, trusting, tolerant, progressive, while another one fights for the right to be able to shoot hundreds of people dead in mins.  Hope is here, just not evenly distributed.

"<s>[INST] Generate a LinkedIn Post for: overhaul the traditional recruitment process for the knowledge economy to prioritize showcasing a candidate's authentic values, skills, and personality through personal online platforms. [/INST] Pretty sure the entire recruitment process should change for the knowledge economy and the best roles within it.  1) Resume's or CV's are about the worst way to judge people. Would be way better to have personal websites where people could articulate what actually matters. Their values, skills and personality. Their hopes and dreams, faults and eccentricities. What they believe and evidence of all this. I'd love to see personal websites used by everyone.  2) The process is appears broken, seems to be designed not to get the best people fastest but to prove that people have worked hard and followed the right proceedure. 3)For understandable reasons, recruitment still focussed entirely on the gaps remaining and the suitability of people to fit them best. Not finding the very best people and accepting this may alter some of the interfaces around it.

When I need to research such places, I find all companies have websites which: 1) Obfuscate what you do. It's literally impossible to understand simply what your company does. Every Single Time. Clarity isn't vulnerability, it's confidence.  2) Seem to suggest your company does everything. I don't want a Takeway that does Pizza and Sushi. Define yourself by what you don't do.  3) Has absolutely crap ways to contact you.  I'm not going to fill in a form, or email "" Info@mycompany.com "", the lack of person makes me think you probably don't exist.  4) Most of what you want to tell me is not something I care about, it's what you care about. P.s- You've no idea how silly it is that all your staff are probably in San Francisco.  Are you trying to face the coders or trying to make money from the largest companies on the planet.  Just trying to help here.
